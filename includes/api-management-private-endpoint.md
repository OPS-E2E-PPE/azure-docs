> [!IMPORTANT]
> * API Management support for private endpoints is currently in **preview**.
> * To enable private endpoints, the API Management instance can't already be configured with an external or internal [virtual network](../articles/api-management/virtual-network-concepts.md).  
> * During the preview period, a private endpoint connection supports only **inbound** traffic to the API Management instance. Outbound traffic isn't supported.
