|[\[Preview\]: API Management Service should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F42daa904-5969-47ef-92cb-b75df946195a) |API Management Service can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. An API Management Service is Zone Redundant if it's sku name is 'Premium' and it has at least two entries in it's zones array. This policy identifies API Management Services lacking the redundancy needed to withstand a zone outage. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Apimanagement_Service_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F408934a8-941a-4c1e-ba88-dd035d9688f4) |Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash instances with fewer than 3 entries in their zones array are not Zone Redundant. This policy identifies Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash instances lacking the redundancy needed to withstand a zone outage. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Cache_redisEnterprise_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

Azure Cache for Redis instances with fewer than 2 entries in their zones array are not Zone Redundant. This policy identifies Azure Cache for Redis instances lacking the redundancy needed to withstand a zone outage. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Cache_Redis_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Data Explorer Clusters should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcbe58ab0-07a8-43ea-9ccc-8ea33e4d6aa5) |Azure Data Explorer Clusters can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. An Azure Data Explorer Cluster is considered Zone Redundant if it has at least two entries in its zones array. This policy helps ensure the your Azure Data Explorer Clusters are Zone Redundant. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Kusto_clusters_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Container Registry should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9d2b0a20-57d6-474c-9d12-44a4a20999c6) |Container Registry can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. When the zoneRedundancy property for a Container Registry is set to 'Disabled', it means the registry is not Zone Redundant. Enforcing this policy helps ensure that your Container Registry is appropriately configured for zone resilience, reducing the risk of downtime during zone outages. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/ContainerRegistry_registries_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Cosmos Database Accounts should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F44c5a1f9-7ef6-4c38-880c-273e8f7a3c24) |Cosmos Database Accounts can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. If the 'enableMultipleWriteLocations' is set to 'true' then all locations must have a 'isZoneRedundant' property and it must be set to 'true'. If the 'enableMultipleWriteLocations' is set to 'false' then the primary location ('failoverPriority' set to 0) must have a 'isZoneRedundant' property and it must be set to 'true'. Enforcing this policy ensures Cosmos Database Accounts are appropriately configured for zone redundancy. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/DocumentDB_databaseAccounts_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Service Bus should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd3ee5dcf-0c6d-49ab-aee4-f250583a7bdc) |Service Bus can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. When the 'zoneRedundant' property is set to 'false' for a Service Bus, it means it is not configured for Zone Redundancy. This policy identifies and enforces the Zone Redundancy configuration for Service Bus instances. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/ServiceBus_namespaces_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Storage Accounts should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F85b005b2-95fc-4953-b9cb-f9ee6427c754) |Storage Accounts can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. If a Storage Account's SKU name does not end with 'ZRS' or its kind is 'Storage,' it is not Zone Redundant. This policy ensures that your Storage Accounts use ae Zone Redundant configuration. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Storage_storageAccounts_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Virtual Machine Scale Sets should be Zone Resilient](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd3903bdf-ab85-4cce-85d3-2934d77629d4) |Virtual Machine Scale Sets can be configured to be either Zone Aligned, Zone Redundant, or neither. Virtual Machine Scale Sets that have exactly one entry in their zones array are considered Zone Aligned. In contrast, Virtual Machine Scale Sets with 3 or more entries in their zones array and a capacity of at least 3 are recognized as Zone Redundant. This policy helps identify and enforce these resilience configurations. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Compute_virtualMachineScaleSets_ZoneResilient_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Virtual Machines should be Zone Aligned](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F42f4f3a2-7d20-4c13-a05d-01857a626c22) |Virtual Machines can be configured to be Zone Aligned or not. They are considered Zone Aligned if they have only one entry in their zones array. This policy ensures that they are configured to operate within a single availability zone. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Compute_virtualMachines_ZoneAligned_Audit.json) |
