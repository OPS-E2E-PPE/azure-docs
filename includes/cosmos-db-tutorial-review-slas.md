2. Click through each of the tabs so you're aware of the metrics that are available. Each graph that's associated with the [Azure Cosmos DB Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db/) provides a line that shows the quota required to meet the SLA versus your actual usage.
