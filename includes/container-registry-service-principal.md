## Create a service principal

To create a service principal with access to your container registry, you can use the following script. Update the `ACR_NAME` variable with the name of your container registry, and optionally the `--role` value in the [az ad sp create-for-rbac][az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac] command to grant different permissions. You must have the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed to use this script.

After you run the script, take note of the service principal's **ID** and **password**. Once you have its credentials, you can configure your applications and services to authenticate to your container registry as the service principal.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Modify for your environment. The ACR_NAME is the name of your Azure Container
# Registry, and the SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME can be any unique name within your
# subscription (you can use the default below).
ACR_NAME=myregistryname
SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=acr-service-principal

# Populate some values required for subsequent command args
ACR_LOGIN_SERVER=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query loginServer --output tsv)
ACR_REGISTRY_ID=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query id --output tsv)

# Create the service principal with rights scoped to the registry.
# Default permissions are for both docker push and pull access. Modify the
# '--role' argument value as desired:
# reader:      pull only
# contributor: push and pull
# owner:       push, pull, and assign roles
SP_PASSWD=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME --scopes $ACR_REGISTRY_ID --role reader --query password --output tsv)
SP_APP_ID=$(az ad sp show --id http://$SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME --query appId --output tsv)

# Output the service principal's credentials; use these in your services and
# applications to authenticate to the container registry.
echo "Service principal ID: $SP_APP_ID"
echo "Service principal password: $SP_PASSWD"
```

## Use an existing service principal

To grant registry access to an existing service principal, you must assign a new role to the service principal. As with creating a new service principal, you can grant pull, push and pull, and owner access.

The following script uses the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command to grant *pull* permissions to a service principal you specify in the `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID` variable. Adjust the `--role` value if you'd like to grant a different level of access.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Modify for your environment. The ACR_NAME is the name of your Azure Container
# Registry, and the SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID is the service principal's 'appId' or
# one of its 'servicePrincipalNames' values.
ACR_NAME=myregistryname
SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID=<service-principal-ID>

# Populate value required for subsequent command args
ACR_REGISTRY_ID=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query id --output tsv)

# Assign the desired role to the service principal. Modify the '--role' argument
# value as desired:
# reader:      pull only
# contributor: push and pull
# owner:       push, pull, and assign roles
az role assignment create --assignee $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID --scope $ACR_REGISTRY_ID --role reader
```
