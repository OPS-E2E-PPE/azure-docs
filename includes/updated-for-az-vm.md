> This article has been updated to use the new [Azure PowerShell Az
> module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). AzureRM will continue to get critical bugfix updates, but 
> new features will be in the Az module only.
> * The Az module is already available on Cloud Shell, with AzureRM compatibility enabled.
> * To install the Az module locally, see [Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
> * If you install the Az module locally, you can enable the AzureRM compatibility by running `Enable-AzureRmAlias`.
