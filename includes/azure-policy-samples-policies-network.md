|Name |Description |Effect(s) |Version |
|---|---|---|---|
|[A custom IPsec/IKE policy must be applied to all Azure virtual network gateway connections](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VPNGateways_CustomIpSecPolicies_Audit.json) |This policy ensures that all Azure virtual network gateway connections use a custom Internet Protocol Security(Ipsec)/Internet Key Exchange(IKE) policy. Supported algorithms and key strengths - https://aka.ms/AA62kb0 |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[App Service should use a virtual network service endpoint](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_AppService_AuditIfNotExists.json) |This policy audits any App Service not configured to use a virtual network service endpoint. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Azure VPN gateways should not use 'basic' SKU](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VPNGateways_BasicSKU_Audit.json) |This policy ensures that VPN gateways do not use 'basic' SKU. |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Cosmos DB should use a virtual network service endpoint](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_CosmosDB_Audit.json) |This policy audits any Cosmos DB not configured to use a virtual network service endpoint. |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Deploy network watcher when virtual networks are created](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkWatcher_Deploy.json) |This policy creates a network watcher resource in regions with virtual networks. You need to ensure existence of a resource group named networkWatcherRG, which will be used to deploy network watcher instances. |DeployIfNotExists |1.0.0 |
|[Event Hub should use a virtual network service endpoint](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_EventHub_AuditIfNotExists.json) |This policy audits any Event Hub not configured to use a virtual network service endpoint. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Gateway subnets should not be configured with a network security group](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkSecurityGroupOnGatewaySubnet_Deny.json) |This policy denies if a gateway subnet is configured with a network security group. Assigning a network security group to a gateway subnet will cause the gateway to stop functioning. |deny |1.0.0 |
|[Key Vault should use a virtual network service endpoint](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_KeyVault_Audit.json) |This policy audits any Key Vault not configured to use a virtual network service endpoint. |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Network interfaces should disable IP forwarding](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkIPForwardingNic_Deny.json) |This policy denies the network interfaces which enabled IP forwarding. The setting of IP forwarding disables Azure's check of the source and destination for a network interface. This should be reviewed by the network security team. |deny |1.0.0 |
|[Network interfaces should not have public IPs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkPublicIPNic_Deny.json) |This policy denies the network interfaces which are configured with any public IP. Public IP addresses allow internet resources to communicate inbound to Azure resources, and Azure resources to communicate outbound to the internet. This should be reviewed by the network security team. |deny |1.0.0 |
|[Network Watcher should be enabled](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkWatcher_Enabled_Audit.json) |Network Watcher is a regional service that enables you to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network scenario level in, to, and from Azure. Scenario level monitoring enables you to diagnose problems at an end to end network level view. Network diagnostic and visualization tools available with Network Watcher help you understand, diagnose, and gain insights to your network in Azure. |auditIfNotExists |1.0.0 |
|[RDP access from the Internet should be blocked](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkSecurityGroup_RDPAccess_Audit.json) |This policy audits any network security rule that allows RDP access from Internet |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
