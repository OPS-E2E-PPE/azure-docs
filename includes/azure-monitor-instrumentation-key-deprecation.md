>[!NOTE] 
>On March 31st, 2025, support for instrumentation key ingestion will end. Instrumentation key ingestion will continue to work, but weâ€™ll no longer provide updates or support for the feature. [Transition to connection strings](../articles/azure-monitor/app/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings.md) to remain supported and take advantage of [new capabilities](../articles/azure-monitor/app/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings.md#new-capabilities).
