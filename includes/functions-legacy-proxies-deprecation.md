> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature of Azure Functions [runtime versions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-versions.md) 1.x to 3.x. Proxies are only supported in version 4.x to allow you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. To take advantage of a more complete set of API behaviors, you should switch to using [Azure API Management](../articles/api-management/api-management-key-concepts.md) for exposing and managing your APIs at the earliest possible convenience.
