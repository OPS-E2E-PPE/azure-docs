> There are two CLI utilities used to manage Service Fabric. [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) is used to manage the Azure resources (such as the Azure Service Fabric service, Azure Networking, Azure Storage, etc.), and [Service Fabric CLI](../articles/service-fabric/service-fabric-cli.md) is used to manage the Service Fabric cluster, regardless of if the cluster is hosted by Azure or is hosted on-prem.
