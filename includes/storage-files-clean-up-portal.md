When you're done, you can delete the resource group, which deletes the storage account, the Azure file share, and any other resources you deployed inside the resource group.

1. In the left menu, click **Resource groups**.
2. Right-click the resource group and select **Delete resource group**. A page opens, warning you about what resources will be deleted along with the resource group.
3. Type the name of the resource group and then click **Delete**.
