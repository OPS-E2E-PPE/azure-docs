- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- This article requires the latest version (2.35.0 or later) of the Azure CLI. See [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're using the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. If you plan to run the commands locally instead of in Azure Cloud Shell, be sure to run them with administrative privileges. For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md).

- Optional: We'd like input on how you plan to use Azure Container Storage. Please complete this [short survey](https://aka.ms/AzureContainerStoragePreviewSignUp).
