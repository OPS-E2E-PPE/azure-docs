If you will be continuing to the next tutorial, you can keep the resources created in this quickstart and reuse them with the next tutorial.

Otherwise, if you are finished with the quickstart sample application, you can delete the Azure resources created in this quickstart to avoid charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible and that the resource group and all the resources in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the resources for hosting this sample inside an existing resource group that contains resources you want to keep, you can delete each resource individually from their respective blades instead of deleting the resource group.

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azconfig/portal) and click **Resource groups**.

In the **Filter by name...** textbox, type the name of your resource group. The instructions for this quickstart used a resource group named *AppConfigTestResources*. On your resource group in the result list, click **...** then **Delete resource group**.

You will be asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Type the name of your resource group to confirm, and click **Delete**.

After a few moments, the resource group and all of its contained resources are deleted.
