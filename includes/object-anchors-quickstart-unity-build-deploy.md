Open the `.sln` file generated by Unity. Change the build configuration to the following.

Next, you'll need to configure the **Remote Machine IP address** to deploy and debug the app.

Click **Debug -> OU Sample Unity Properties -> Debug**, change the **Machine Name** to your device's IP address.

Close the property page. Click **Remote Machine**. The app should start to build and deploy to your remote device. Make sure your device is active.
