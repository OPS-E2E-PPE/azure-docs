You can use either the Azure Cloud Shell or a local Azure CLI.

- [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) with the Bash environment. Or launch the Cloud Shell here.

   [![Launch Cloud Shell in a new window](media/cloud-shell-try-it/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
- Local Azure CLI, see how to [install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

  - Sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

  - When you first use Azure CLI, install the Azure CLI extension. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
  
  - Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).
