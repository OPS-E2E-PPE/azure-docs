> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on April 1, 2023, Microsoft will stop accepting checks as a payment method for subscriptions paid by invoice. Beginning on that date, pay by check will no longer be available as a payment option, and check payment instructions will be removed from invoices. You can still pay for your invoice by electronic funds transfer (EFT). See your invoice for EFT payment information. If you're an existing customer who currently pays by check, you have until September 30, 2023 to change to paying by EFT, and avoid possible service disruption.
