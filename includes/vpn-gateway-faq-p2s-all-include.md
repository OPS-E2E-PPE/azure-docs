### <a name="supportedclientos"></a>What client operating systems can I use with Point-to-Site?

The following client operating systems are supported:

* Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit only)
* Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows 8.1 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows Server 2012 (64-bit only)
* Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit only)
* Windows 10
* OSX version 10.11 for Mac (El Capitan)
* macOS version 10.12 for Mac (Sierra)

### How many VPN client endpoints can I have in my Point-to-Site configuration?

We support up to 128 VPN clients to be able to connect to a virtual network at the same time.

### Can I traverse proxies and firewalls using Point-to-Site capability?

Azure supports two types of Point-to-site VPN options:

* Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP)

  SSTP is a Microsoft proprietary SSL-based solution that can penetrate firewalls since most firewalls open the TCP port that 443 SSL uses.

* IKEv2 VPN

  IKEv2 VPN is a standards-based IPsec VPN solution that uses UDP port 500 and 4500 and IP protocol no. 50. Firewalls do not always open these ports, so there is a possibility of IKEv2 VPN not being able to traverse proxies and firewalls.

### If I restart a client computer configured for Point-to-Site, will the VPN automatically reconnect?

By default, the client computer will not reestablish the VPN connection automatically.

### Does Point-to-Site support auto-reconnect and DDNS on the VPN clients?

Auto-reconnect and DDNS are currently not supported in Point-to-Site VPNs.

### Can I have Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site configurations coexist for the same virtual network?

Yes. For the Resource Manager deployment model, you must have a RouteBased VPN type for your gateway. For the classic deployment model, you need a dynamic gateway. We do not support Point-to-Site for static routing VPN gateways or PolicyBased VPN gateways.

### Can I configure a Point-to-Site client to connect to multiple virtual networks at the same time?

No. A Point-to-Site client can only connect to resources in the VNet in which the virtual network gateway resides.

### How much throughput can I expect through Site-to-Site or Point-to-Site connections?

It's difficult to maintain the exact throughput of the VPN tunnels. IPsec and SSTP are crypto-heavy VPN protocols. Throughput is also limited by the latency and bandwidth between your premises and the Internet. For a VPN Gateway with only IKEv2 Point-to-Site VPN connections, the total throughput that you can expect depends on the Gateway SKU. For more information on throughput, see [Gateway SKUs](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md#gwsku).

### Can I use any software VPN client for Point-to-Site that supports SSTP and/or IKEv2?

No. You can only use the native VPN client on Windows for SSTP, and the native VPN client on Mac for IKEv2. Refer to the list of supported client operating systems.
