> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is in preview. To use it, you must install the [Event Grid extension](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-list) for [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can install it with `az extension add --name eventgrid`. If you previously installed the extension, update it with `az extension update -n eventgrid`. If you are using the REST API, ensure you are using `api-version=2018-09-15-preview`.
