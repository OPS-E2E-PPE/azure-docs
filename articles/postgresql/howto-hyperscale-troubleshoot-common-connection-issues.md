# Troubleshoot connection issues to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)

Connection problems may be caused by a variety of things, including:

* Firewall settings
* Connection time-out
* Incorrect login information
* Connection limit reached for server group
* Issues with the infrastructure of the service
* Maintenance being performed in the service
* The coordinator node failing over to new hardware

Generally, connection issues to Hyperscale can be classified as follows:

* Transient errors (short-lived or intermittent)
* Persistent or non-transient errors (errors that regularly recur)

## Troubleshoot transient errors

Transient errors occur when maintenance is performed, the system encounters an
error with the hardware or software, or briefly after you change the vCores of
your coordinator node. The nodes in a Hyperscale server group have configurable
high availability designed to mitigate these types of problems automatically.
However, your application can lose its connection to the server for a short
period of time even with high availability enabled. Some events can
occasionally take longer to mitigate, such as when a large transaction causes a
long-running recovery.

### Steps to resolve transient connectivity issues

1. Check the [Microsoft Azure Service
   Dashboard](https://azure.microsoft.com/status) for any known outages that
   occurred during the time in which the errors were reported by the application.
2. Applications that connect to a cloud service such as Azure Database for
   PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) should expect transient errors and implement
   retry logic to handle these errors instead of surfacing these as application
   errors to users.
3. As the server group approaches its resource limits, errors can seem like
   transient connectivity issues. Increasing node RAM, or adding worker nodes
   and rebalancing data may help.
4. If connectivity problems continue, or if the duration for which your
   application encounters the error exceeds 60 seconds or if you see multiple
   occurrences of the error in a given day, file an Azure support request by
   selecting **Get Support** on the [Azure
   Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options) site.

## Troubleshoot persistent errors

If the application persistently fails to connect to Hyperscale (Citus), it
usually indicates an issue with one of the following:

* Coordinator node firewall configuration: Make sure that the Hyperscale server
  firewall is configured to allow connections from your client, including proxy
  servers and gateways.
* Client firewall configuration: The firewall on your client must allow
  connections to your database server. IP addresses and ports of the server
  that you cannot to must be allowed as well as application names such as
  PostgreSQL in some firewalls.
* User error: You might have mistyped connection parameters, such as the server
  name in the connection string or a missing *\@servername* suffix in the user
  name.

### Steps to resolve persistent connectivity issues

1. Set up [firewall rules](howto-hyperscale-manage-firewall-using-portal.md) to
   allow the client IP address. For temporary testing purposes only, set up a
   firewall rule using 0.0.0.0 as the starting IP address and using
   255.255.255.255 as the ending IP address. This will open the server to all IP
   addresses. If this resolves your connectivity issue, remove this rule and
   create a firewall rule for an appropriately limited IP address or address
   range.
2. On all firewalls between the client and the internet, make sure that port
   5432 is open for outbound connections.
3. Verify your connection string and other connection settings.
4. Check the service health in the dashboard.
