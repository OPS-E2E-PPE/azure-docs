# Monitor metrics on Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

Monitoring data about your servers helps you troubleshoot and optimize for your workload. Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides various monitoring options to provide insight into the behavior of your server.

## Metrics
Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides various metrics that give insight into the behavior of the resources supporting the PostgreSQL server. Each metric is emitted at a one-minute frequency, and has up to [93 days of history](../../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md#retention-of-metrics). You can configure alerts on the metrics. Other options include setting up automated actions, performing advanced analytics, and archiving history. For more information, see the [Azure Metrics Overview](../../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md).

### List of metrics
The following metrics are available for PostgreSQL flexible server:

## Enhanced Metrics

Introducing Enhanced Metrics for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server to enable more fine grained monitoring and alerting on databases. You can configure alerts on the metrics. In addition, some of these new Metrics now also include ‘Dimension’ that will allow to split and filter the metrics data by using the allowed dimension such as Database Name, State etc. 

#### Enabling enhanced metrics

- Most of these new metrics are _disabled_ by default, barring a few exceptions (per the list below) 
- To enable these metrics, please turn ON the server parameter `metrics.collector_database_activity`. This parameter is dynamic, and will not require instance restart.

^ **Max Connections** here represents the configured value for _max_connections_ server parameter, and this metric is pooled every 30 minutes.

#### Considerations when using the enhanced metrics

- There is **50 database** limit on metrics with `database name` dimension.
  * On **Burstable** SKU -  this limit is 10 `database name` dimension
- `database name` dimension limit is applied on OiD column (in other words Order-of-Creation of the database)
- The `database name` in metrics dimension is **case insensitive**. Therefore the metrics for same database names in varying case (_ex. foo, FoO, FOO_) will be merged, and may not show accurate data.

## Autovacuum metrics

Autovaccum metrics can be used to monitor and tune autovaccum performance for Azure database for postgres flexible server. Each metric is emitted at a **30 minute** frequency, and has up to **93 days** of retention. Customers can configure alerts on the metrics and can also access the new metrics dimensions, to split and filter the metrics data on database name.

#### Enabling Autovacuum metrics
* Autovacuum metrics are disabled by default
* To enable these metrics, please turn ON the server parameter `metrics.autovacuum_diagnostics`. 
  * This parameter is dynamic, hence will not require instance restart.

#### Considerations when using the autovacuum metrics

- There is **30 database** limit on metrics with `database name` dimension.
  * On **Burstable** SKU -  this limit is 10 `database name` dimension
- `database name` dimension limit is applied on OiD column (in other words Order-of-Creation of the database)

## Applying filters and splitting on metrics with dimension

In the above list of metrics, some of the metrics have dimension such as `database name`, `state` etc. [Filtering](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts.md#filters) and [Splitting](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts.md#apply-splitting) are allowed for the metrics that have dimensions. These features show how various metric segments ("dimension values") affect the overall value of the metric. You can use them to identify possible outliers.

* **Filtering** lets you choose which dimension values are included in the chart. For example, you might want to show idle connections when you chart the `Sessions-by-State`  metric. You apply the filter on the __idle__ on __state__ dimension.
* **Splitting** controls whether the chart displays separate lines for each value of a dimension or aggregates the values into a single line. For example, you can see one line for an `Sessions-by-State` metric across all sessions. Or you can see separate lines for each session grouped by their `state`. You apply splitting on the `State` dimension to see separate lines. 

Here in this example below, we have done **splitting** by `State` dimension and **filtered** on a specific `state` types.

## Server logs
In addition to the metrics, Azure Database for PostgreSQL also allows you to configure and access PostgreSQL standard logs. To learn more about logs, visit the [logging concepts doc](concepts-logging.md).
