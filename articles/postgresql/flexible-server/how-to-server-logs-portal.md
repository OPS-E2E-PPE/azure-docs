# Enable, list and download server logs for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

You can use server logs to help monitor and troubleshoot an instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server, and to gain detailed insights into the activities that have run on your servers.

By default, the server logs feature in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is disabled. However, after you enable the feature, a flexible server starts capturing events of the selected log type and writes them to a file. You can then use the Azure portal or the Azure CLI to download the files to assist with your troubleshooting efforts. This article explains how to enable the server logs feature in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server and download server log files. It also provides information about how to disable the feature.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to:
- Enable the server logs feature.
- Disable the server logs feature.
- Download server log files.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need an existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server. If you need to create a new server, see [Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](./quickstart-create-server-portal.md).

## Enable Server logs

To enable the server logs feature, perform the following steps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your PostgreSQL flexible server.

2. On the left pane, under **Monitoring**, select **Server logs**.

4. To configure retention period (in days), choose the slider. Minimum retention 1 days and Maximum retention is 7 days.

> [!NOTE]
> In managing server logs, you should be aware of two key parameters: `logfiles.download_enable` and `logfiles.retention_days`. It is important to note that users are not required to explicitly configure these settings. The Azure portal simplifies this process through its server logs management interface. `The logfiles.download_enable` parameter, which controls the enabling or disabling of server logs, is managed via the '**Enable**' checkbox in the server logs section. Similarly, the `logfiles.retention_days` parameter, which sets the duration for retaining server logs can be easily adjusted using the '**Retention Period (in days)**' slider.

## Download Server logs

To download server logs, perform the following steps.

> [!Note]
> After enabling logs, the log files will be available to download after few minutes.

1. Under **Name**, select the log file you want to download, and then, under **Action**, select **Download**.

2. To download multiple log files at one time, under **Name**, select the files you want to download, and then above **Name**, select **Download**.
