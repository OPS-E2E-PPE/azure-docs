# Security in Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Hyperscale (Citus)

This page outlines the multiple layers of security available to protect the data in your
Hyperscale (Citus) server group. 

## Information protection and encryption

### In transit

Whenever data is ingested into a node, Hyperscale (Citus) secures your data by
encrypting it in-transit with Transport Layer Security 1.2. Encryption
(SSL/TLS) is always enforced, and can’t be disabled.

### At rest

The Hyperscale (Citus) service uses the FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic
module for storage encryption of data at-rest. Data, including backups, are
encrypted on disk, including the temporary files created while running queries.
The service uses the AES 256-bit cipher included in Azure storage encryption,
and the keys are system-managed. Storage encryption is always on, and can't be
disabled.
