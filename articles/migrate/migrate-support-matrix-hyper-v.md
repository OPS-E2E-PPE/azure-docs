# Support matrix for Hyper-V assessment

This article summarizes support settings and limitations for assessing Hyper-V VMs with [Azure Migrate: Server Assessment](migrate-services-overview.md#azure-migrate-server-assessment-tool) . If you're looking for information about migrating Hyper-V VMs to Azure, review the [migration support matrix](migrate-support-matrix-hyper-v-migration.md).

## Overview

To assess on-premises machines for migration to Azure with this article, you add the Azure Migrate: Server Assessment tool to an Azure Migrate project. You deploy the [Azure Migrate appliance](migrate-appliance.md). The appliance continuously discovers on-premises machines, and sends configuration and performance data to Azure. After machine discovery, you gather discovered machines into groups, and run an assessment for a group.


## Limitations

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Assessment limits**| Discover and assess up to 35,000 Hyper-V VMs in a single [project](migrate-support-matrix.md#azure-migrate-projects).
**Project limits** | You can create multiple projects in an Azure subscription. A project can include VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, and physical servers, up to the assessment limits.
**Discovery** | The Azure Migrate appliance can discover up to 5000 Hyper-V VMs.<br/><br/> The appliance can connect to up to 300 Hyper-V hosts.
**Assessment** | You can add up to 35,000 machines in a single group.<br/><br/> You can assess up to 35,000 VMs in a single assessment.

## Hyper-V host requirements

| **Support**                | **Details**               
| :-------------------       | :------------------- |
| **Host deployment**       | The Hyper-V host can be standalone or deployed in a cluster. |
| **Permissions**           | You need administrator permissions on the Hyper-V host. <br/> Alternatively, if you don't want to assign Administrator permissions, create a local or domain user account and add the user to these groups- Remote Management Users, Hyper-V Administrators and Performance Monitor Users. |
| **Host operating system** | Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2.<br/> You can't assess VMs located on Hyper-V hosts running Windows Server 2012. |
| **PowerShell Remoting**   | Must be enabled on each host. |
| **Hyper-V Replica**       | If you use Hyper-V Replica (or you have multiple VMs with the same VM identifiers), and discover both the original and replicated VMs using Azure Migrate, the assessment generated by Azure Migrate might not be accurate. |


## Hyper-V VM requirements

| **Support**                  | **Details**               
| :----------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Operating system** | All [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) operating systems that are supported by Azure. |
| **Integration Services**       | [Hyper-V Integration Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/integration-services) must be running on VMs that you assess, in order to capture operating system information. |


## Azure Migrate appliance requirements

Azure Migrate uses the [Azure Migrate appliance](migrate-appliance.md) for discovery and assessment. The appliance for Hyper-V runs on a Hyper-V VM, and is deployed using a compressed Hyper-V VHD that you download from the Azure portal. 

- Learn about [appliance requirements](migrate-appliance.md#appliance---hyper-v) for Hyper-V.
- Learn about [URLs](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) the appliance needs to access.

## Port access

The following table summarizes port requirements for assessment.

**Device** | **Connection**
--- | ---
**Appliance** | Inbound connections on TCP port 3389 to allow remote desktop connections to the appliance.<br/> Inbound connections on port 44368 to remotely access the appliance management app using the URL: ``` https://<appliance-ip-or-name>:44368 ```<br/> Outbound connections on ports 443, 5671 and 5672 to send discovery and performance metadata to Azure Migrate.
**Hyper-V host/cluster** | Inbound connections on WinRM ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS) to pull configuration and performance metadata of the Hyper-V VMs using a Common Information Model (CIM) session.
