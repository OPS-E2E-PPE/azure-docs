|-------------------|------------|
| 8000-8400 | 30.0 |

### S-band
| Uplink Frequencies (MHz) | EIRP (dBW) | Downlink Frequencies (MHz) | G/T (dB/K) |
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------|------------|
| 2025-2120 | 52.0 | 2200-2300 | 15.0 |

## Partner ground stations
