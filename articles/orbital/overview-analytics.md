# What is Azure Orbital Analytics?

Azure Orbital Analytics are Azure capabilities using spaceborne data and AI that allow you to discover and distribute the most valuable insights from your spaceborne data to take action in less time.

## What it provides

Azure Orbital Analytics provides the ability to downlink spaceborne data from Azure Orbital Ground Station (AOGS), first- or third-party archives, or customer-acquired data directly into Azure. This data is efficiently stored using Azure Data and Storage services. From there, you can convert raw spaceborne sensor data into analysis-ready data using Azure Orbital Analytics processing pipelines. 

## Integrations

Derive insights on data by applying AI models, integrating applications, and more. Partner AI models and Microsoft tools extract the highest precision results. Finally, deliver data to destinations such as Microsoft Teams, Power Platform, or process it using open-source tools. Azure Orbital Analytics enables scenarios including land classification, asset monitoring, object detection, and more.

## Partnerships

Azure Orbital Analytics is the pathway between satellite operators and Microsoft customers. Partnerships with [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en), [Blackshark.ai](https://blackshark.ai/technology/), and [Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/) enable information extraction and publishing to Esriâ€™s ArcGIS workflows. 

Orbital Analytics for Azure Synapse applies artificial intelligence over satellite imagery at scale using Azure resources.
