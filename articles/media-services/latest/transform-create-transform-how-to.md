# Create a transform

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

The Azure CLI script in this article shows how to create a transform. Transforms describe a simple workflow of tasks for processing your video or audio files (often referred to as a "recipe"). You should always check if a Transform with desired name and "recipe" already exist. If it does, you should reuse it.

## Prerequisites

[Create a Media Services account](./account-create-how-to.md).

## Code snippets

## [Portal](#tab/portal/)

[!INCLUDE [task-create-asset-portal](includes/task-create-transform-portal.md)]
