# View your recent sign-in activity on the My Profile (preview) portal
You can view all of your recent sign-in activity using your work or school account, from the **Recent activity** page of the **My Profile** portal.

## View your recent sign-in activity
1. Sign in to your work or school account and then go to your https://myprofile.microsoft.com/ page.

2. Select **Recent activity** from the left navigation pane or select the **Review activity** link from the **Recent activity** block.

3. Expand and review each of the sign-in items, making sure that you recognize each one. If you find an sign-in item that doesn't look familiar, we highly recommend you change your password to help protect your account if it was compromised.
