    - Data sharing and privacy notification on the clean install EULA page.

    - Data sharing and privacy notification on the upgrade page.

    - A new additional task **Privacy Settings** where the user can change their preferences.

### Network Policy Server extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication 


**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:**  Multi-factor authentication  
**Product capability:** User authentication




The Network Policy Server extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication adds cloud-based multi-factor authentication capabilities to your authentication infrastructure by using your existing servers.

### Use "OR" between controls in a conditional access policy 


**Type:** Changed feature

**Product capability:** Identity security and protection

 
You now can use "OR" (require one of the selected controls) for conditional access controls. You can use this feature to create policies with "OR" between access controls.

### Aggregation of real-time risk events


**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** Identity protection  
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection


In Azure AD Identity Protection, all real-time risk events that originated from the same IP address on a given day are now aggregated for each risk event type. This change limits the volume of risk events shown without any change in user security.

The underlying real-time detection works each time the user signs in. If you have a sign-in risk security policy set up to multi-factor authentication or block access, it is still triggered during each risky sign-in.

### Automatic sign-in field detection


**Type:** Fixed   
**Service category:** My Apps  
**Product capability:** Single sign-on  



Azure AD supports automatic sign-in field detection for applications that render an HTML user name and password field. These steps are documented in [How to automatically capture sign-in fields for an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/application-config-sso-problem-configure-password-sso-non-gallery#how-to-manually-capture-sign-in-fields-for-an-application). You can find this capability by adding a *Non-Gallery* application on the **Enterprise Applications** page in the [Azure portal](http://aad.portal.azure.com). Additionally, you can configure the **Single Sign-on** mode on this new application to **Password-based Single Sign-on**, enter a web URL, and then save the page.
 
Due to a service issue, this functionality was temporarily disabled. The issue was resolved, and the automatic sign-in field detection is available again.

### New multi-factor authentication features

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** My Apps  
**Product capability:** Single sign-on  



You now can better manage apps that show up on your users' portals through a new **hide app** property.
