### Azure AD Domain Services Email Notifications

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services

Azure AD Domain Services provides alerts on the Azure portal about misconfigurations or problems with your managed domain. These alerts include step-by-step guides so you can try to fix the problems without having to contact support.

Starting in October, you'll be able to customize the notification settings for your managed domain so when new alerts occur, an email is sent to a designated group of people, eliminating the need to constantly check the portal for updates.

For more information, see [Notification settings in Azure AD Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-notifications).

### Azure AD portal supports using the ForceDelete domain API to delete custom domains 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Directory Management  
**Product capability:** Directory

We're pleased to announce that you can now use the ForceDelete domain API to delete your custom domain names by asynchronously renaming references, like users, groups, and apps from your custom domain name (contoso.com) back to the initial default domain name (contoso.onmicrosoft.com).

This change helps you to more quickly delete your custom domain names if your organization no longer uses the name, or if you need to use the domain name with another Azure AD.

For more information, see [Delete a custom domain name](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/domains-manage#delete-a-custom-domain-name).

**Service category:** SSPR  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

After you set up this new feature, your users will see a link to reset their password from the **Lock** screen of a device running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1. By clicking that link, the user is guided through the same password reset flow as through the web browser.

For more information, see [How to enable password reset from Windows 7, 8, and 8.1](https://aka.ms/ssprforwindows78)

---

### Change notice: Authorization codes will no longer be available for reuse 

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting on November 15, 2018, Azure AD will stop accepting previously used authentication codes for apps. This security change helps to bring Azure AD in line with the OAuth specification and will be enforced on both the v1 and v2 endpoints.

If your app reuses authorization codes to get tokens for multiple resources, we recommend that you use the code to get a refresh token, and then use that refresh token to acquire additional tokens for other resources. Authorization codes can only be used once, but refresh tokens can be used multiple times across multiple resources. An app that attempts to reuse an authentication code during the OAuth code flow will get an invalid_grant error.

For this and other protocols-related changes, see [the full list of what's new for authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes).

## August 2018

### Changes to Azure Active Directory IP address ranges

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Platform

We're introducing larger IP ranges to Azure AD, which means if you've configured Azure AD IP address ranges for your firewalls, routers, or Network Security Groups, you'll need to update them. We're making this update so you won't have to change your firewall, router, or Network Security Groups IP range configurations again when Azure AD adds new endpoints. 

Network traffic is moving to these new ranges over the next two months. To continue with uninterrupted service, you must add these updated values to your IP Addresses before September 10, 2018:

- 20.190.128.0/18 

- 40.126.0.0/18 

We strongly recommend not removing the old IP Address ranges until all of your network traffic has moved to the new ranges. For updates about the move and to learn when you can remove the old ranges, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).

### Change notice: Authorization codes will no longer be available for reuse 

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting on November 15, 2018, Azure AD will stop accepting previously used authentication codes for apps. This security change helps to bring Azure AD in line with the OAuth specification and will be enforced on both the v1 and v2 endpoints.

If your app reuses authorization codes to get tokens for multiple resources, we recommend that you use the code to get a refresh token, and then use that refresh token to acquire additional tokens for other resources. Authorization codes can only be used once, but refresh tokens can be used multiple times across multiple resources. An app that attempts to reuse an authentication code during the OAuth code flow will get an invalid_grant error.

### Converged security info management for self-service password (SSPR) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** SSPR  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
This new feature helps people manage their security info (such as, phone number, mobile app, and so on) for SSPR and MFA in a single location and experience; as compared to previously, where it was done in two different locations.

This converged experience also works for people using either SSPR or MFA. Additionally, if your organization doesn't enforce MFA or SSPR registration, people can still register any MFA or SSPR security info methods allowed by your organization from the My Apps portal.

This is an opt-in public preview. Administrators can turn on the new experience (if desired) for a selected group or for all users in a tenant. For more information about the converged experience, see the [Converged experience blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/08/06/mfa-and-sspr-updates-now-in-public-preview/)

### New HTTP-Only cookies setting in Azure AD Application proxy apps

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

There's a new setting called, **HTTP-Only Cookies** in your Application Proxy apps. This setting helps provide extra security by including the HTTPOnly flag in the HTTP response header for both Application Proxy access and session cookies, stopping access to the cookie from a client-side script and further preventing actions like copying or modifying the cookie. Although this flag hasn't been used previously, your cookies have always been encrypted and transmitted using an SSL connection to help protect against improper modifications.

This setting isn't compatible with apps using ActiveX controls, such as Remote Desktop. If you're in this situation, we recommend that you turn off this setting.

For more information about the HTTP-Only Cookies setting, see [Publish applications using Azure AD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-publish-azure-portal).

---

### Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure resources supports Management Group resource types

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Just-In-Time activation and assignment settings can now be applied to Management Group resource types, just like you already do for Subscriptions, Resource Groups, and Resources (such as VMs, App Services, and more). In addition, anyone with a role that provides administrator access for a Management Group can discover and manage that resource in PIM.

For more information about PIM and Azure resources, see [Discover and manage Azure resources by using Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-discover-resources)
 
---

### Application access (preview) provides faster access to the Azure AD portal

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Today, when activating a role using PIM, it can take over 10 minutes for the permissions to take effect. If you choose to use Application access, which is currently in public preview, administrators can access the Azure AD portal as soon as the activation request completes.

Currently, Application access only supports the Azure AD portal experience and Azure resources. For more information about PIM and Application access, see [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)

### Converged security info management for self-service password reset and Multi-Factor Authentication

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** SSPR  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

This new feature lets users manage their security info (for example, phone number, email address, mobile app, and so on) for self-service password reset (SSPR) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in a single experience. Users will no longer have to register the same security info for SSPR and MFA in two different experiences. This new experience also applies to users who have either SSPR or MFA.

If an organization isn't enforcing MFA or SSPR registration, users can register their security info through the **My Apps** portal. From there, users can register any methods enabled for MFA or SSPR. 

This is an opt-in public preview. Admins can turn on the new experience (if desired) for a selected group of users or all users in a tenant.

---
 
### Use the Microsoft Authenticator app to verify your identity when you reset your password

**Type:** Changed feature

After admins turn on this self-service password reset method, users who have registered a mobile app through aka.ms/mfasetup or aka.ms/setupsecurityinfo can use their mobile app as a verification method while resetting their password.

Mobile app notification can only be turned on as part of a policy that requires two methods to reset your password.

### Change notice: Security fix to the delegated authorization flow for apps using Azure AD Activity Logs API

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

Due to our stronger security enforcement, we’ve had to make a change to the permissions for apps that use a delegated authorization flow to access [Azure AD Activity Logs APIs](https://aka.ms/aadreportsapi). This change will occur by **June 26, 2018**.

If any of your apps use Azure AD Activity Log APIs, follow these steps to ensure the app doesn’t break after the change happens.

**To update your app permissions**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **App Registrations**.
2. Select your app that uses the Azure AD Activity Logs API, select **Settings**, select **Required permissions**, and then select the **Windows Azure Active Directory** API.
3. In the **Delegated permissions** area of the **Enable access** blade, select the box next to **Read directory** data, and then select **Save**.
4. Select **Grant permissions**, and then select **Yes**.
    
    >[!Note]
    >You must be a Global administrator to grant permissions to the app.

For more information, see the [Grant permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-api-prerequisites-azure-portal#grant-permissions) area of the Prerequisites to access the Azure AD reporting API article.

### Configure TLS settings to connect to Azure AD services for PCI DSS compliance

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications and is the most widely deployed security protocol used today.

The [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) has determined that early versions of TLS and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) must be disabled in favor of enabling new and more secure app protocols, with compliance starting on **June 30, 2018**. This change means that if you connect to Azure AD services and require PCI DSS-compliance, you must disable TLS 1.0. Multiple versions of TLS are available, but TLS 1.2 is the latest version available for Azure Active Directory Services. We highly recommend moving directly to TLS 1.2 for both client/server and browser/server combinations.

Out-of-date browsers might not support newer TLS versions, such as TLS 1.2. To see which versions of TLS are supported by your browser, go to the [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) site and click **Test your browser**. We recommend you upgrade to the latest version of your web browser and preferably enable only TLS 1.2.

**To enable TLS 1.2, by browser**

- **Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer (both are set using Internet Explorer)**

    1. Open Internet Explorer, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**.
    2. In the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    3. Close all browser windows and restart Internet Explorer. 

- **Google Chrome**

    1. Open Google Chrome, type *chrome://settings/* into the address bar, and press **Enter**.
    2. Expand the **Advanced** options, go to the **System** area, and select **Open proxy settings**.
    3. In the **Internet Properties** box, select the **Advanced** tab, go to the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    4. Close all browser windows and restart Google Chrome.

- **Mozilla Firefox**

    1. Open Firefox, type *about:config* into the address bar, and then press **Enter**.
    2. Search for the term, *TLS*, and then select the **security.tls.version.max** entry.
    3. Set the value to **3** to force the browser to use up to version TLS 1.2, and then select **OK**.

        >[!NOTE]
        >Firefox version 60.0 supports TLS 1.3, so you can also set the security.tls.version.max value to **4**.

    4. Close all browser windows and restart Mozilla Firefox.

## May 2018

### ExpressRoute support changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform  

Software as a Service offering, like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are designed to work best by going directly through the Internet, without requiring ExpressRoute or any other private VPN tunnels. Because of this, on **August 1, 2018**, we will stop supporting ExpressRoute for Azure AD services using Azure public peering and Azure communities in Microsoft peering. Any services impacted by this change might notice Azure AD traffic gradually shifting from ExpressRoute to the Internet.

While we're changing our support, we also know there are still situations where you might need to use a dedicated set of circuits for your authentication traffic. Because of this, Azure AD will continue to support per-tenant IP range restrictions using ExpressRoute and services already on Microsoft peering with the "Other Office 365 Online services" community. If your services are impacted, but you require ExpressRoute, you must do the following:

- **If you're on Azure public peering.** Move to Microsoft peering and sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online services (12076:5100)** community. For more info about how to move from Azure public peering to Microsoft peering, see the [Move a public peering to Microsoft peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/how-to-move-peering) article.

- **If you're on Microsoft peering.** Sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. For more info about routing requirements, see the [Support for BGP communities section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing#bgp) of the ExpressRoute routing requirements article.

If you must continue to use dedicated circuits, you'll need to talk to your Microsoft Account team about how to get authorization to use the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. The MS Office-managed review board will verify whether you need those circuits and make sure you understand the technical implications of keeping them. Unauthorized subscriptions trying to create route filters for Office 365 will receive an error message.

### Improvements to the B2B redemption experience and leave an org

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

**Just in time redemption:** Once you share a resource with a guest user using B2B API – you don’t need to send out a special invitation email. In most      cases, the guest user can access the resource and will be taken through the redemption experience just in time. No more impact due to missed emails. No more asking your guest users “Did you click on that redemption link the system sent you?”. This means once SPO uses the invitation manager – cloudy attachments can have the same canonical URL for all users – internal and external – in any state of redemption.

**Modern redemption experience:** No more split screen redemption landing page. Users will see a modern consent experience with the inviting organization's privacy statement, just like they do for third-party apps.

**Guest users can leave the org:** Once a user’s relationship with an org is over, they can self-serve leaving the organization. No more calling the inviting org’s admin to “be removed”, no more raising support tickets.

### ID tokens can no longer be returned using the query response_mode for new apps. 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Apps created on or after April 25, 2018 will no longer be able to request an **id_token** using the **query** response_mode.  This brings Azure AD inline with the OIDC specifications and helps reduce your apps attack surface.  Apps created before April 25, 2018 are not blocked from using the **query** response_mode with a response_type of **id_token**.  The error returned, when requesting an id_token from AAD, is **AADSTS70007: ‘query’ is not a supported value of ‘response_mode’ when requesting a token**.

The **fragment** and **form_post** response_modes continue to work - when creating new application objects (for example, for App Proxy usage), ensure use of one of these response_modes before they create a new application.
