|Create federation settings for a federated domain     | [Create internalDomainFederation](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-post-federationconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta)        | [New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.directorymanagement/new-mgdomainfederationconfiguration?view=graph-powershell-beta)        |
|Remove federation settings for a federated domain     | [Delete internalDomainFederation](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/internaldomainfederation-delete?view=graph-rest-beta)        | [Remove-MgDomainFederationConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.directorymanagement/remove-mgdomainfederationconfiguration?view=graph-powershell-beta)     |

### Public Preview – Ability to force reauthentication on Intune enrollment, risky sign-ins, and risky users

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC role  
**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation  
**Clouds impacted:** Public (Microsoft 365, GCC)

###  Public Preview – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
**Clouds impacted:** Public (Microsoft 365, GCC)

We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values). 

We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

### Public Preview - New APIs for fetching transitive role assignments and role permissions

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC role  
**Product capability:** Access Control  
 

1. **transitiveRoleAssignments** - Last year the ability to assign Azure AD roles to groups was created. Originally it took four calls to fetch all direct, and transitive, role assignments of a user. This new API call allows it all to be done via one API call. For more information, see:
[List transitiveRoleAssignment - Microsoft Graph beta | Microsoft Docs](/graph/api/rbacapplication-list-transitiveroleassignments).

2. **unifiedRbacResourceAction** - Developers can use this API to list all role permissions and their descriptions in Azure AD. This API can be thought of as a dictionary that can help build custom roles without relying on UX. For more information, see:
[List resourceActions - Microsoft Graph beta | Microsoft Docs](/graph/api/unifiedrbacresourcenamespace-list-resourceactions).

**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 
We previously announced in April 2020, a new combined registration experience enabling users to register authentication methods for SSPR and multi-factor authentication at the same time was generally available for existing customer to opt in. Any Azure AD tenants created after August 2020 automatically have the default experience set to combined registration.

### Pre-authentication error events removed from Azure AD Sign-in Logs

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting  
 
We’re no longer publishing sign-in logs with the following error codes because these events are pre-authentication events that occur before our service has authenticated a user. Because these events happen before authentication, our service isn’t always able to correctly identify the user. If a user continues on to authenticate, the user sign-in will show up in your tenant Sign-in logs. These logs are no longer visible in the Azure portal UX, and querying these error codes in the Graph API will no longer return results.

|Error code | Failure reason|
| --- | --- |
|50058|	Session information isn’t sufficient for single-sign-on.|
|16000| Either multiple user identities are available for the current request or selected account isn’t supported for the scenario.|
|500581| Rendering JavaScript. Fetching sessions for single-sign-on on V2 with prompt=none requires JavaScript to verify if any MSA accounts are signed in.|
|81012| The user trying to sign in to Azure AD is different from the user signed into the device.|

### Windows users will see prompts more often when switching user accounts

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
A problematic interaction between Windows and a local Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) instance can result in users attempting to sign into another account, but be silently signed into their existing account instead, with no warning. For federated IdPs such as ADFS, that support the [prompt=login](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login) pattern, Azure AD will now trigger a fresh login at ADFS when a user is directed to ADFS with a login hint. This ensures that the user is signed into the account they requested, rather than being silently signed into the account they're already signed in with. 

For more information, see the [change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md).
