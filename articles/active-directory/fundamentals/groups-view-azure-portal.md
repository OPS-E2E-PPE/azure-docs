# Quickstart: Create a group with members and view all groups and members

You can view your organization's existing groups and group members using the Microsoft Entra Admin Center. Groups are used to manage users that all need the same access and permissions for potentially restricted apps and services.

In this quickstart, you’ll set up a new group and assign members to the group. Then you'll view your organization's group and assigned members. Throughout this guide, you'll create a user and group that you can use in other quickstarts and tutorials.

If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you’ll need to:

- Create an Azure Active Directory tenant. For more information, see [Access the Azure portal and create a new tenant](./create-new-tenant.md).

## Create a new group 

Create a new group, named _MDM policy - West_. For more information about creating a group, see [How to create a basic group and add members](./how-to-manage-groups.md).

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#user-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. Select **New group**.
1. Complete the **Group** page:
    
    - **Group type:** Select **Security**
    - **Group name:** Type _MDM policy - West_
    - **Membership type:** Select **Assigned**.

1. Select **Create**.

## Create a new user

A user must exist before being added as a group member, so you'll need to create a new user. For this quickstart, we've added a user named _Alain Charon_. Check the "Custom domain names" tab first to get the verified domain name in which to create users. For more information about creating a user, see [How to add or delete users](./add-users.md).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users**.
1. Select  **New user** > **Create new user**.
1. Complete the **User** page:

   - **User principal name:** Type *alain\@contoso.com*.
   - **Display name:** Type _Alain Charon_.

1. Copy the auto-generated password provided in the **Password** box and select **Create**.

## Add a group member

Now that you have a group and a user, you can add _Alain Charon_ as a member to the _MDM policy - West_ group. For more information about adding group members, see the [Manage groups](how-to-manage-groups.md) article.

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. Select the **MDM policy - West** group created earlier.
1. From the **MDM policy - West Overview** page, select **Members**.
1. Select **Add members**, and then search and select **Alain Charon**.
1. Choose **Select**.

## View all groups

You can see all the groups for your organization in the **Groups - All groups** page.

- Browse to **Identity** > **Groups** > **All groups**.

    The **All groups** page appears, showing all your active groups.

## Search for a group

Search the **All groups** page to find the **MDM policy – West** group.

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. From the **All groups** page, type _MDM_ into the **Search** box.

    The search results appear under the **Search** box, including the _MDM policy - West_ group.

1. View the group info on the **MDM policy - West Overview** page, including the number of members of that group.

## View group members

Now that you’ve found the group, you can view all the assigned members.

Select **Members** from the **Manage** area, and then review the complete list of member names assigned to that specific group, including _Alain Charon_.

## Clean up resources

The group you just created is used in other articles in this documentation. If you'd rather not use this group, you can delete it and its assigned members using the following steps:

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. On the **All groups** page, search for the **MDM policy - West** group.
1. Select the **MDM policy - West** group.

   The **MDM policy - West Overview** page appears.

1. Select **Delete**.

   The group and its associated members are deleted.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This doesn't delete the user Alain Charon, just his membership in the deleted group.
   > 
   > To delete your test user: Browse to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users** select your test user and choose **Delete**.
