# Entra Verified ID supported standards

[!INCLUDE [Verifiable Credentials announcement](../../../includes/verifiable-credentials-brand.md)]

Microsoft is actively collaborating with members of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the W3C Credentials Community Group, and the wider identity community. Weâ€™ve worked with these groups to identify and develop critical standards, and have implemented the open standards in our services. This page outlines currently supported open standards for Microsoft Entra Verified ID.

## Standard bodies

- [OpenID Foundation (OIDF)](https://openid.net/foundation/)
- [Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)](https://identity.foundation/)
- [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/)
- [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/)

## Supported standards

Entra Verified ID supports the following open standards:

|secp256k1|ES256K|
|Ed25519|EdDSA|

## Interoperability

Microsoft is collaborating with organizations members of Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the W3C Credentials Community Group, and the wider identity community. Our collaboration efforts aim to build a Verifiable Credentials Interoperability profile to support standards based issuance, revocation, presentation and wallet portability.

Today, we have a working JWT VC presentation profile that supports interoperable presentation of Verifiable Credentials between Wallets and Verifiers/RPs. Join us at DIF Claims and Credentials working group: [aka.ms/vcinterop](https://aka.ms/vcinterop)
