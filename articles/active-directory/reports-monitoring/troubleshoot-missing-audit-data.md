# Troubleshoot: Missing data in the Azure Active Directory activity log 


## Symptoms

I performed some actions in the Azure portal and expected to see the audit logs for those actions in the `Activity logs > Audit Logs` blade, but I can’t find them.

## Cause

Actions don’t appear immediately in the activity logs. The table below enumerates our latency numbers for activity logs. 

| Report | &nbsp; | Latency (P95) | Latency (P99) |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Directory audit | &nbsp; | 2 mins | 5 mins |
| Sign-in activity | &nbsp; | 2 mins | 5 mins | 

## Resolution

Wait for 15 minutes to two hours and see if the actions appear in the log. If you don’t see the logs even after two hours, please [file a support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) and we will look into it.
