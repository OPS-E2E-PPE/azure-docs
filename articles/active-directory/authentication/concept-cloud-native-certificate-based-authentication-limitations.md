# Limitations with cloud native certificate-based authentication in Azure Active Directory

This topic covers supported and unsupported scenarios for cloud native certificate-based authentication in Azure Active Directory.

>[!NOTE]
>Cloud-native certificate-based authentication is currently in public preview. Some features might not be supported or have limited capabilities. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are supported:

- User sign-ins to web browser-based applications on all platforms.
- User sign-ins on mobile Native browsers.
- Support for granular authentication rules for multifactor authentication by using the certificate issuer **Subject** and **policy OIDs**.
- Configuring certificate-to-user account bindings by using the certificate Subject Alternate Name (SAN) principal name and SAN RFC822 name.

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios aren't supported:

- Public Key Infrastructure for creating client certificates. Customers need to configure their own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and provision certificates to their users and devices. 
- Certificate Authority hints are not supported so the list of certificates that appears for users in the UI isn't scoped.
- Windows login using smart cards on Windows devices.
- Only one Certificate Distribution Point for a trusted CA is supported.
- The Certificate Distribution Point can be only HTTP URLs. We don't support Online Certificate Status Protocol (OSCP), or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URLs.
- Configuring other certificate-to-user account bindings, such as using the **subject field**, or **keyid** and **issuer**, arenâ€™t available in this release.
- Currently, password can't be disabled when CBA is enabled and the option to sign in using a password is displayed.
