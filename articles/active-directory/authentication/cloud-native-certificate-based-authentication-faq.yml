  >[!NOTE]
  >Cloud-native certificate-based authentication is currently in public preview. Some features might not be supported or have limited capabilities. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

      - question: |
          How do I enable cloud-native CBA?
        answer: |
          1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a Global Administrator.
          1. Click **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Authentication methods** > **Certificate-based Authentication** > **Basics**, click **On** to enable certificate-based authentication.

      - question: |
          Is cloud-native CBA a free feature?
        answer: |
          Certificate-based authentication is a free feature. 
          Every edition of Azure AD includes cloud-native CBA.
          For more information about features in each Azure AD edition, see [Azure AD pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

      - question: |
          Does cloud-native CBA support Alternate ID as the username instead of userPrincipalName?
        answer: |
          No, sign-in using a non-UPN value, such as an alternate email, isn't supported now.
          
      - question: |
          Can I have more than one CertificateDistributionPoint (CDP) for a Certificate Authority (CA)?
        answer: |
          No, only one CDP is supported per CA.

      - question: |
          Can I have non-http URLs for CDP?
        answer: |
          No, CDP supports only HTTP URLs.

      - question: |
          How do I turn certificate revocation checking on or off for a particular CA?
        answer: |
          We highly recommend not to disable certificate revocation list (CRL) checking as you will not be able to revoke certificates. 
          However, to disable CRL checking if there are issues with CRL for a particular CA, you can update a trusted certificate authority and set the crlDistributionPoint attribute to """.
          
          Use the [Set-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureadtrustedcertificateauthority) cmdlet:
          
          ```powershell
          $c=Get-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority
          $c[0]. crlDistributionPoint =””
          Set-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority -CertificateAuthorityInformation $c[0]
          ```

      - question: |
          Is there a limit for CRL size?
        answer: |
          Today as part of the public preview CRL sizes are limited as follows:
          
          - 20MB in commercial (Microsoft 365, GCC)
          - 45MB in US Government (GCC High, Dept. of Defense)

          We are reviewing the impact of these limits during public preview.

      - question: |
          Will the changes to authentication policy change take effect immediately?
        answer: |
          The policy is cached. After a policy update, it may take up to an hour for the changes to be effective.
          
      - question: |
          How do I instantly revoke a certificate?
        answer: |
          Please follow the steps to [manually revoke a certificate](active-directory-certificate-based-authentication-get-started.md#step-3-configure-revocation).
