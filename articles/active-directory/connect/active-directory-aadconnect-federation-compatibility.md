# Azure AD federation compatibility list
Azure Active Directory provides single-sign on and enhanced application access security for Office 365 and other Microsoft Online services for hybrid and cloud-only implementations without requiring any third party solution. Office 365, like most of Microsoftâ€™s Online services, is integrated with Azure Active Directory for directory services, authentication, and authorization. Azure Active Directory also provides single sign-on to thousands of SaaS applications and on-premises web applications. See the Azure Active Directory [application gallery](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps) for supported SaaS applications. 

## IDP Validation
If your organization uses a third-party federation solution, you can configure single sign-on for your on-premises Active Directory users with Microsoft Online services provided that the third-party federation solution is compatible with Azure Active Directory. The following is a list of [compatible providers](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56843) that were validated by Oxford Computer Group on behalf of Microsoft, as of November 2017. 

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft no longer provides validation testing to independent identity providers for compatibility with Azure Active Directory. Microsoft encourages identity providers to use the self-service [documents](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56843) to validate compatibility with Azure Active Directory.
