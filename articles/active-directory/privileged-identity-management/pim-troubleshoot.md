# Troubleshoot a problem with Privileged Identity Management

Are you having a problem with Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)? The information that follows can help you to get things working again.

## Access to Azure resources denied

### Problem

You get an authorization error when you try to make a user eligible for an Azure AD admin role and you are unable to access Azure resources under Privileged Identity Management. You are unable to access Azure resources under Privileged Identity Management even if you are a Global admin and the owner of the subscription.

### Cause

This problem can happen when the User Access Administrator role for the PIM service principal was accidentally removed from the subscription. For the Privileged Identity Management service to be able to access Azure resources, the MS-PIM service principal should always have be assigned the [User Access Administrator role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) over the Azure subscription.

### Resolution

Assign the User Access Administrator role to the Privileged identity Management service principal name (MSâ€“PIM) at the subscription level. This assignment should allow the Privileged identity Management service to access the Azure resources. The role can be assigned on a management group level or at the subscription level, depending on your requirements. For more information service principals, see [Assign an application to a role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-the-application-to-a-role).
