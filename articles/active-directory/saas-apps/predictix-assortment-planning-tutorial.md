# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Predictix Assortment Planning

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Predictix Assortment Planning with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
This integration provides these benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to Predictix Assortment Planning.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to Predictix Assortment Planning (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you start.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.
