# Support and help options for developers

If you're just starting to integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft identities, or Microsoft Graph API, or when you're implementing a new feature to your application, there are times when you need to obtain help from the community or understand the support options that you have as a developer. Here are suggestions for where you can get help when developing your Microsoft identity platform solutions.

## Create an Azure support request

<div class='icon is-large'>
    <img alt='Azure support' src='https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo_azure.svg'>
</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- If you are not an Azure customer, you can also open a support request with Microsoft via [our commercial support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).

## Post a question to Microsoft Q&A

Get answers to your identity app development questions directly from Microsoft engineers, Azure Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), and members of our expert community.

[Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/) is Azure's recommended source of community support.

If you can't find an answer to your problem by searching Microsoft Q&A, submit a new question. Use one of following tags when you ask your [high-quality question](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/articles/24951/how-to-write-a-quality-question.html):
