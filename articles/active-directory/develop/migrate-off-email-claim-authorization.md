# Migrate away from using email claims for authorization

This article is meant to provide guidance to developers whose applications are currently using a pattern where the email claim is used for authorization, which can lead to full account takeover by another user. Continue reading to learn more about if your application is impacted, and steps for remediation. 

## How do I know if my application is impacted?

Microsoft recommends reviewing application source code and determining whether the following patterns are present: 

- A mutable claim, such as `email`, is used for the purposes of uniquely identifying a user
- A mutable claim, such as `email` is used for the purposes of authorizing a user's access to resources

These patterns are considered insecure, as users without a provisioned mailbox can have any email address set for their Mail (Primary SMTP) attribute. This attribute is **not guaranteed to come from a verified email address**. When an unverified email claim is used for authorization, any user without a provisioned mailbox has the potential to gain unauthorized access by changing their Mail attribute to impersonate another user. 

This risk of unauthorized access has only been found in multi-tenant apps, as a user from one tenant could escalate their privileges to access resources from another tenant through modification of their Mail attribute.

## Migrate applications to more secure configurations

You should never use mutable claims (such as `email`, `preferred_username`, etc.) as identifiers to perform authorization checks or index users in a database. These values are re-usable and could expose your application to privilege escalation attacks. 

If your application is currently using a mutable value for indexing users, you should migrate to a globally unique identifier, such as the object ID (referred to as `oid` in the token claims). Doing so ensures that each user is indexed on a value that can't be re-used (or abused to impersonate another user). 


If your application uses email (or any other mutable claim) for authorization purposes, you should read through the [Secure applications and APIs by validating claims](claims-validation.md) and implement the appropriate checks. 

## Short-term risk mitigation

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access before updating application code, you can use the `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` property for the optional `email` claim, which replaces (or removes) email claims, depending on account type, according to the following table: 

| **User type** | **Replaced with** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| On Premise | Home tenant UPN |
| Cloud Managed | Home tenant UPN |
| Microsoft Account (MSA) | Email address the user signed up with |
| Email OTP | Email address the user signed up with |
| Social IDP: Google | Email address the user signed up with | 
| Social IDP: Facebook | Email claim isn't issued |
| Direct Fed | Email claim isn't issued |

Enabling `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` eliminates the most significant risk of cross-tenant privilege escalation by ensuring authorization doesn't occur against an arbitrarily set email value.  While enabling this property prevents unauthorized access, it can also break access to users with unverified emails. Internal data suggests the overall percentage of users with unverified emails is low and this tradeoff is appropriate to secure applications in the short term. 

The `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` option is also documented under the documentation for [additional properties of optional claims](active-directory-optional-claims.md#additional-properties-of-optional-claims).

Enabling `replace_unverified_email_with_upn` should be viewed mainly as a short-term risk mitigation strategy while migrating applications away from email claims, and not as a permanent solution for resolving account escalation risk related to email usage.
