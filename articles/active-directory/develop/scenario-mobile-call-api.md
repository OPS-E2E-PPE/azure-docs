# Mobile app that calls web APIs - call a web API

Once your app has signed in a user and received tokens, MSAL exposes several pieces of information about the user, their environment, and the tokens issued. Your app can use these values to call a web API or display a welcome message to a user.

First, we will explore the MSAL result, then how to use an access token from the `AuthenticationResult` or `result` to call a protected web API.

## MSAL result

- `AccessToken`: Used to call protected web APIs in a HTTP Bearer request.
- `IdToken`: Contains useful claims about the signed in user like their name, home tenant, and unique identifier for storage.
- `ExpiresOn`: the expiration time of the token. MSAL handles auto-refresh for apps.
- `TenantId`: The identifier of the user's tenant used to sign in. For guest users (Azure AD B2B), this will be the tenant the user signed in with, not their home tenant.  
- `Scopes`: the scopes that were granted with your token. This may be a subset of what you requested.

Additionally, MSAL also provides an abstraction for an `Account`. An Account represents the current user's signed in account.

- `HomeAccountIdentifier`: The identifier of the user's home tenant.
- `UserName`: The user's preferred username. This may be empty for Azure AD B2C users.
- `AccountIdentifier`: The identifier of the signed in user. This will be the same as the `HomeAccountIdentifier` in most cases unless the user is a guest in another tenant.

## Calling an API

Once you have the Access token ready, it's simple to call a web API. Your app will take this token, construct an HTTP request, and execute it.

### Android

```Java
        RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);
        JSONObject parameters = new JSONObject();

        try {
            parameters.put("key", "value");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Error when constructing
        }
        JsonObjectRequest request = new JsonObjectRequest(Request.Method.GET, MSGRAPH_URL,
                parameters,new Response.Listener<JSONObject>() {
            @Override
            public void onResponse(JSONObject response) {
                // Successfully called graph, process data and send to UI 
            }
        }, new Response.ErrorListener() {
            @Override
            public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error) {
                // Error
            }
        }) {
            @Override
            public Map<String, String> getHeaders() throws AuthFailureError {
                Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<>();
                
                // Put Access Token in HTTP request 
                headers.put("Authorization", "Bearer " + authResult.getAccessToken());
                return headers;
            }
        };

        request.setRetryPolicy(new DefaultRetryPolicy(
                3000,
                DefaultRetryPolicy.DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES,
                DefaultRetryPolicy.DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MULT));
        queue.add(request);
```

### iOS

```swift
        let url = URL(string: kGraphURI)
        var request = URLRequest(url: url!)

        // Put Access token in HTTP Request
        request.setValue("Bearer \(self.accessToken)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")

        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            if let error = error {
                self.updateLogging(text: "Couldn't get graph result: \(error)")
                return
            }
            guard let result = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data!, options: []) else {
                self.updateLogging(text: "Couldn't deserialize result JSON")
                return
            }

            // Successfully got data from Graph
            self.updateLogging(text: "Result from Graph: \(result))")
        }.resume()
```

### Xamarin

```CSharp
httpClient = new HttpClient();

// Put Access token in HTTP request 
httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);

// Call Graph
HttpResponseMessage response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(apiUri);
...
}
```

## Making several API requests

If you need to call the same API several times or multiple APIs, there are additional considerations when building your app:

- ***Incremental consent***: Microsoft identity platform allows apps to get user consent as permission are required, rather than all up-front. Each time your app is ready to call an API, it should request only the scopes it intends to use.
- ***Conditional access***: In certain scenarios, you may get additional Conditional Access requirements when making several API requests. To handle this scenario, be sure to catch errors from silent requests and be prepared to make an interactive request. This can happen if the first request has no Conditional Access policies applied and your app attempts to silently access a new API that requires Conditional Access. To learn more, see [Guidance for conditional access](conditional-access-dev-guide.md).
