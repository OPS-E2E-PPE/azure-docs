# Azure Active Directory Conditional Access technical reference

With [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) conditional access](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md), you can fine-tune how authorized users can access your resources.  
This topic provides you with support information for the following items of a conditional access policy: 

- Cloud apps assignments

- Client apps conditions



## Cloud apps assignments

When you configure a conditional access policy, you need to [select the cloud apps your policy applies to](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md#who).

### Microsoft cloud apps

You can assign a conditional access policy to the following cloud apps from Microsoft:

- Azure Remote App

- Dynamics CRM

- Microsoft Office 365 Yammer

- Microsoft Office 365 Exchange Online

- Microsoft Office 365 SharePoint Online (includes OneDrive for Business)

- Microsoft Power BI 

- Visual Studio Team Services

- Microsoft Teams


### Other apps 

In addition to the Microsoft cloud apps, you can assign a conditional access policy to the following types of cloud apps:

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)-connected applications

- Pre-integrated federated software as a service (SaaS) applications

- Applications that use password single sign-on (SSO)

- Line-of-business applications

- Applications that use Azure AD Application Proxy. 


## Client apps conditions 

When you configure a conditional access policy, you can set a [client apps condition](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md#client-apps). The client apps condition enables you to grant or block access when an access attempt was made from these types of client apps:

- Browser
- Mobile apps and desktop apps

### Supported browsers 

If you select *Browsers* in your conditional access policy to grant access to resources, access is only granted, when the access attempt is made using a supported browser. When an access attempt is made using an unsupported browser, the attempt is blocked.

![Supported browsers](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference/05.png)

In your conditional access policy, the following browsers are supported:
