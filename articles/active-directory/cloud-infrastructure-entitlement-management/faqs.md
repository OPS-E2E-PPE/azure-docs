This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox).

## What's CloudKnox Permissions Management?

CloudKnox is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities. For example, over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multi-cloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). CloudKnox detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions. It deepens the Zero Trust security strategy by augmenting the least privilege access principle.


## What are the prerequisites to use CloudKnox?

CloudKnox supports data collection from AWS, GCP, and/or Microsoft Azure. For data collection and analysis, customers are required to have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account to use CloudKnox.

## Can a customer use CloudKnox if they have other identities with access to their IaaS platform that aren't yet in Azure AD (for example, if part of their business has Okta or AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM))?

Yes, a customer can detect, mitigate, and monitor the risk of 'backdoor' accounts that are local to AWS IAM, GCP, or from other identity providers such as Okta or AWS IAM.

## Where can customers access CloudKnox?

Customers can access the CloudKnox interface with a link from the Azure AD extension in the Azure portal.

## Can non-cloud customers use CloudKnox on-premises?

No, CloudKnox is a hosted cloud offering.

## Can non-Azure customers use CloudKnox?

Yes, non-Azure customers can use our solution. CloudKnox is a multi-cloud solution so even customers who have no subscription to Azure can benefit from it.

## Is CloudKnox available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU)?

No, the CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) PREVIEW is currently not available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).

## If I'm already using Azure AD  Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure, what value does CloudKnox provide?

CloudKnox complements Azure AD PIM. Azure AD PIM provides just-in-time access for admin roles in Azure (as well as Microsoft Online Services and apps that use groups), while CloudKnox allows multi-cloud discovery, remediation, and monitoring of privileged access across Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## What languages does CloudKnox support?

CloudKnox currently supports English.

## What public cloud infrastructures are supported by CloudKnox?

CloudKnox currently supports the three major public clouds: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

## Does CloudKnox support hybrid environments?

CloudKnox currently doesn't support hybrid environments.

## What types of identities are supported by CloudKnox?

CloudKnox supports user identities (for example, employees, customers, external partners) and workload identities (for example, virtual machines, containers, web apps, serverless functions).

<!---## Is CloudKnox General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant?

CloudKnox is currently not GDPR compliant.--->

## Is CloudKnox available in Government Cloud?

No, CloudKnox is currently not available in Government clouds.

## Is CloudKnox available for sovereign clouds?

No, CloudKnox is currently not available in sovereign Clouds.

## How does CloudKnox collect insights about permissions usage?

CloudKnox has a data collector that collects access permissions assigned to various identities, activity logs, and resources metadata. This gathers full visibility into permissions granted to all identities to access the resources and details on usage of granted permissions.

## How does CloudKnox evaluate cloud permissions risk?

CloudKnox offers granular visibility into all identities and their permissions granted versus used, across cloud infrastructures to uncover any action performed by any identity on any resource. This isn't limited to just user identities, but also workload identities such as virtual machines, access keys, containers, and scripts. The dashboard gives an overview of permission profile to locate the riskiest identities and resources.

## What is the Permissions Creep Index?

The Permissions Creep Index (PCI) is a quantitative measure of risk associated with an identity or role determined by comparing permissions granted versus permissions exercised. It allows users to instantly evaluate the level of risk associated with the number of unused or over-provisioned permissions across identities and resources. It measures how much damage identities can cause based on the permissions they have.

## How can customers use CloudKnox to delete unused or excessive permissions?

CloudKnox allows users to right-size excessive permissions and automate least privilege policy enforcement with just a few clicks. The solution continuously analyzes historical permission usage data for each identity and gives customers the ability to right-size permissions of that identity to only the permissions that are being used for day-to-day operations. All unused and other risky permissions can be automatically removed.

## How can customers grant permissions on-demand with CloudKnox?

For any break-glass or one-off scenarios where an identity needs to perform a specific set of actions on a set of specific resources, the identity can request those permissions on-demand for a limited period with a self-service workflow. Customers can either use the built-in workflow engine or their IT service management (ITSM) tool. The user experience is the same for any identity type, identity source (local, enterprise directory, or federated) and cloud.

## What is the difference between permissions on-demand and just-in-time access?

Just-in-time (JIT) access is a method used to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure identities are given the minimum level of permissions to perform the task at hand. Permissions on-demand are a type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.

## How can customers monitor permissions usage with CloudKnox?

Customers only need to track the evolution of their Permission Creep Index to monitor permissions usage. They can do this in the "Analytics" tab in their CloudKnox dashboard where they can see how the PCI of each identity or resource is evolving over time.

## Can customers generate permissions usage reports?

Yes, CloudKnox has various types of system report available that capture specific data sets. These reports allow customers to:
- Make timely decisions.
- Analyze usage trends and system/user performance.
- Identify high-risk areas.

For information about permissions usage reports, see [Generate and download the Permissions analytics report](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).

## Does CloudKnox integrate with third-party ITSM (Information Technology Security Management) tools?

CloudKnox integrates with ServiceNow.


## How is CloudKnox being deployed?

Customers with Global Admin role have first to onboard CloudKnox on their Azure AD tenant, and then onboard their AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions. More details about onboarding can be found in our product documentation.

## How long does it take to deploy CloudKnox?

It depends on each customer and how many AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions they have.

## Once CloudKnox is deployed, how fast can I get permissions insights?

Once fully onboarded with data collection set up, customers can access permissions usage insights within hours. Our machine-learning engine refreshes the Permission Creep Index every hour so that customers can start their risk assessment right away.

## Is CloudKnox collecting and storing sensitive personal data?

No, CloudKnox doesn't have access to sensitive personal data.

## Where can I find more information about CloudKnox?

You can read our blog and visit our web page. You can also get in touch with your Microsoft point of contact to schedule a demo.
