Statistical anomalies can detect outliers in an identity's behavior if recent activity is determined to be unusual based on models defined in an activity trigger. The goal of this anomaly trigger is a high recall rate.

## View statistical anomalies in an identity's behavior

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select **Activity triggers** (the bell icon).
1. Select **Statistical anomaly**, and then select the **Alerts** subtab.

    The **Alerts** subtab displays the following information:

      - **Alert Name**: Lists the name of the alert.
      - **Anomaly Alert Rule**: Displays the name of the rule select when creating the alert. 
      - **# of Occurrences**: Displays how many times the alert trigger has occurred.
      - **Task**: Displays how many tasks are affected by the alert.
      - **Resources**: Displays how many resources are affected by the alert.
      - **Identity**: Displays how many identities are affected by the alert.
      - **Authorization System**: Displays which authorization systems the alert applies to.
      - **Date/Time**: Lists the date and time of the alert.
      - **Date/Time (UTC)**: Lists the date and time of the alert in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
      -  **Activity** section displays details about the **Identity Name**, **Resource Name**, **Task Name**, **Date**, and **IP Address**.
      - **View Trigger**: Displays the current trigger settings and applicable authorization system details.

1. To filter the alerts, select the appropriate alert name or choose **All** from the **Alert Name** dropdown menu. 
1. From the **Date** dropdown menu, select **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 2 Days**, **Last Week**, or **Custom Range**, and select **Apply**.

    - If you select **Custom Range**, also enter **From** and **To** duration settings.
1. To view details that match the alert criteria, select the ellipses (...).

    For example, **Authorization System Type**, **Authorization Systems**, **Resources**, **Tasks**, and **Identities**.

## Create a statistical anomaly trigger

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select **Activity triggers** (the bell icon).
1. Select **Statistical anomaly**, select the **Alerts** subtab, and then select **Create alert trigger**.
1. Enter a name for the alert in the **Alert Name** box.
1. Select the **Authorization system**, Amazon Web Services (**AWS**), Microsoft **Azure**, or Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**).
1. Select one of the following conditions:

      - **Identity Performed High Number of Tasks**: The identity performs at a higher volume than usual. The typical performance is 25 tasks per day and they're now performing 100 tasks per day.
      - **Identity Performed Low Number of Tasks**: The identity performs lower than their daily average. The typical performance is 100 tasks per day and they're now performing 25 tasks per day.
      - **Identity Performed Tasks with Multiple Unusual Patterns**: The identity does many unusual tasks and at different times. This means that identities can execute actions outside their normally logged hours or performance hours, and at a higher than usual volume of tasks than normal.
      - **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Results**: The identity performing an action gets a different result than usual, such as most tasks end in a successful result and are now ending in a failed result or vice versa.
      - **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Timing**: The identity does tasks outside of their normal logged in time or performance hours determined by the UTC actions hours grouped as follows:
           - 12AM-4AM UTC
           - 4AM-8AM UTC
           - 8AM-12PM UTC
           - 12PM-4PM UTC
           - 4PM-8PM UTC
           - 8PM-12AM UTC
      - **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Types**: The identity does unusual types of tasks from their normal tasking, for example, read, write, or delete tasks they wouldn't ordinarily perform.
1. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Authorization systems** tab, select the appropriate systems, or, to select all systems, select **All**. 

    The screen defaults to the **List** view but you can switch to **Folder** view using the menu, and then select the applicable folder instead of individually by system. 

     - The **Status** column displays if the authorization system is online or offline. 

     - The **Controller** column displays if the controller is enabled or disabled.


1. On the **Configuration** tab, to update the **Time Interval**, from the **Time range** dropdown, select **90 Days**, **60 Days**, or **30 Days**, and then select **Save**.

## View statistical anomaly triggers

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select **Activity triggers** (the bell icon).
1. Select **Statistical anomaly**, and then select the **Alert triggers** subtab.

    The **Alert triggers** subtab displays the following information:

      - **Alert**: Displays the name of the alert.
      - **Anomaly alert rule**: Displays the name of the rule select when creating the alert. 
      - **# of users subscribed**: Displays the number of users subscribed to the alert.
      - **Created by**: Displays the email address of the user who created the alert.
      - **Last modified by**: Displays the email address of the user who last modified the alert.
      - **Last modified on**: Displays the date and time the trigger was last modified.
      - **Subscription**: Toggle the button to **On** or **Off**.

1. To filter by **Activated** or **Deactivated**, in the **Status** section, select **All**, **Activated**, or **Deactivated**, and then select **Apply**.

1. To view other options available to you, select the ellipses (**...**), and then make a selection from the available options:

      - **Details**: Displays **Authorization System Type**, **Authorization Systems**, **Resources**, **Tasks**, and **Identities** that matched the alert criteria.
      - To view the specific matches, select **Resources**, **Tasks**, or **Identities**.
      - The **Activity** section displays details about the **Identity Name**, **Resource Name**, **Task Name**, **Date**, and **IP Address**.
      - **View Trigger**: Displays the current trigger settings and applicable authorization system details.

1. Select **Apply**.
