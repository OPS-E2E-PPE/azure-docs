# View personal and organization information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) is currently in PREVIEW.

The **Account settings** dashboard in CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) allows you to view personal information, passwords, and account preferences. 
This information can't be modified because the user information is pulled from Azure AD. Only **User Session Time(min)**

## View personal information

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, and then select **Account Settings**.

    The **Personal Information** box displays your **First Name**, **Last Name**, and the **Email Address** that was used to register your account on CloudKnox.

## View current organization information

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, and then select **Account Settings**.

    The **Current Organization Information** displays the **Name** of your organization, the **Tenant ID** box, and the **User Session Timeout (min)**.

1. To change duration of the **User Session Timeout (min)**, select **Edit** (the pencil icon), and then enter the number of minutes before you want a user session to time out.
1. Select the check mark to confirm your new setting.
