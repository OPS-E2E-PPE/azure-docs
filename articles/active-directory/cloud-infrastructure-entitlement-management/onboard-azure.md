# Onboard a Microsoft Azure subscription

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is currently in PREVIEW.
> Some information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

> [!NOTE]
> The Permissions Management PREVIEW is currently not available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).

This article describes how to onboard a Microsoft Azure subscription or subscriptions on Permissions Management (Permissions Management). Onboarding a subscription creates a new authorization system to represent the Azure subscription in Permissions Management.

> [!NOTE]
> A *global administrator* or *super admin* (an admin for all authorization system types) can perform the tasks in this article after the global administrator has initially completed the steps provided in [Enable Permissions Management on your Azure Active Directory tenant](onboard-enable-tenant.md).

## Prerequisites

To add Permissions Management to your Azure AD tenant:
- You must have an Azure AD user account and an Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) on your system, or an Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- You must have **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission at the subscription or management group scope to perform these tasks. If you don't have this permission, you can ask someone who has this permission to perform these tasks for you.

## How to onboard an Azure subscription

1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches:

    - In the Permissions Management home page, select **Settings** (the gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.

1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **Azure**, and then select **Create Configuration**.

### 1. Add Azure subscription details

1. On the **Permissions Management Onboarding - Azure Subscription Details** page, enter the **Subscription IDs** that you want to onboard.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To locate the Azure subscription IDs, open the **Subscriptions** page in Azure.
   > You can enter up to 10 subscriptions IDs. Select the plus sign **(+)** icon next to the text box to enter more subscriptions.

1. From the **Scope** dropdown, select **Subscription** or **Management Group**. The script box displays the role assignment script.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Select **Subscription** if you want to assign permissions separately for each individual subscription. The generated script has to be executed once per subscription.
   > Select **Management Group** if all of your subscriptions are under one management group. The generated script must be executed once for the management group.

1. To give this role assignment to the service principal, copy the script to a file on your system where Azure CLI is installed and execute it.

    You can execute the script once for each subscription, or once for all the subscriptions in the management group.

1. From the **Enable Controller** dropdown, select:

    - **True**, if you want the controller to provide Permissions Management with read and write access so that any remediation you want to do from the Permissions Management platform can be done automatically.
    - **False**, if you want the controller to provide Permissions Management with read-only access.

1. Return to **Permissions Management Onboarding - Azure Subscription Details** page and select **Next**.

### 2. Review and save.

- In **Permissions Management Onboarding â€“ Summary** page, review the information you've added, and then select **Verify Now & Save**.

    The following message appears: **Successfully Created Configuration.**

    On the **Data Collectors** tab, the **Recently Uploaded On** column displays **Collecting**. The **Recently Transformed On** column displays **Processing.**

    You have now completed onboarding Azure, and Permissions Management has started collecting and processing your data.

### 3. View the data.

- To view the data, select the **Authorization Systems** tab.

    The **Status** column in the table displays **Collecting Data.**

    The data collection process will take some time, depending on the size of the account and how much data is available for collection.
