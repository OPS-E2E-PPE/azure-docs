# View information about roles/ policies in the Remediation dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) is currently in PREVIEW.
> Some information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

The **Remediation** dashboard in CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) enables system administrators to view, adjust, and remediate excessive permissions based on a user's activity data. You can use the **Roles/Policies** subtab in the dashboard to view information about roles and policies in the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems. 

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation dashboard** tab, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you donâ€™t have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other Cloud providers call *policy*. CloudKnox automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.


## View information about roles/policies

1. On the CloudKnox home page, select the **Remediation** tab, and then select the **Role/Policies** subtab.

    The **Role/Policies list** displays a list of existing roles/policies and the following information about each role/policy
        - **Role/Policy Name**: The name of the roles/policies available to you.
        - **Role/Policy Type**: **Custom**, **System**, or **CloudKnox Only**
        - **Actions**: The type of action you can perform on the role/policy, **Clone**, **Modify**, or **Delete**


1. To display details about the role/policy and view its assigned tasks and identities, select the arrow to the left of the role/policy name. 

    The **Tasks** list appears, displaying:
    - A list of **Tasks**.
    - **For AWS:** 
        - The **Users**, **Groups**, and **Roles** the task is **Directly Assigned To**.
        - The **Group Members** and **Role Identities** the task is **Indirectly Accessible By**. 

    - **For Azure:** 
        - The **Users**, **Groups**, **Enterprise Applications** and **Managed Identities** the task is **Directly Assigned To**.
        - The **Group Members** the task is **Indirectly Accessible By**.

    - **For GCP:** 
        - The **Users**, **Groups**, and **Service Accounts** the task is **Directly Assigned To**.
        - The **Group Members** the task is **Indirectly Accessible By**.

1. To close the role/policy details, select the arrow to the left of the role/policy name.

## Export information about roles/policies

- **Export CSV**: Select this option to export the displayed list of roles/policies as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. 

    When the file is successfully exported, a message appears: **Exported Successfully.**

        - The **Role Policy Details** report in CSV format.
        - The **Reports** dashboard where you can configure how and when you can automatically receive reports.




## Filter information about roles/policies
