# Create a role/policy in the Remediation dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) is currently in PREVIEW.
> Some information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

This article describes how you can use the **Remediation** dashboard in CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) to create roles/policies for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems. 

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** tab, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you donâ€™t have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other cloud providers call *policy*. CloudKnox automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

    - **Activity of user(s)**: Allows you to create a policy based on user activity.
    - **Activity of group(s)**: Allows you to create a policy based on the aggregated activity of all the users belonging to the group(s).
    - **Activity of resource(s)**: Allows you to create a policy based on the activity of a resource, for example, an EC2 instance.
