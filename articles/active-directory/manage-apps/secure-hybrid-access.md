# Secure hybrid access: Protect legacy apps with Azure Active Directory

In this article, learn to protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications by connecting them to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

* **Application Proxy**:
  * Protect users, apps, and data in the cloud and on-premises 
  * Use it to publish on-premises web applications externally
  * [Remote access to on-premises applications through Azure AD Application Proxy](../app-proxy/application-proxy.md)
* **Secure hybrid access through Azure AD partner integrations**:
  * Pre-built solutions
  * Conditional Access policies per application
  * [What is Conditional Access?](../conditional-access/overview.md)
  * Azure AD integration documentation

In addition to Application Proxy, you can strengthen your security posture with Identity Protection.

* [What is Identity Protection?](../identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)
* [Using Azure AD Application Proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md)

## Single sign-on and multi-factor authentication

With Azure AD as an identity provider (IdP), you can use modern authentication and authorization methods like single sign-on (SSO) and Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure legacy, on-premises applications.

* [What is SSO in Azure Active Directory?](what-is-single-sign-on.md)
* [How it works: Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md)

## Secure hybrid access with Application Proxy

Use Application Proxy to protect users, apps, and data in the cloud, and on premises. Use this tool for secure remote access to on-premises web applications. Users donâ€™t need to use a virtual private network (VPN); they connect to applications from devices with SSO.

* [Tutorial: Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure AD](../app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md)
* [How to configure SSO to an Application Proxy application](../app-proxy/application-proxy-config-sso-how-to.md)
* [Using Azure AD Application Proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md)

### Application publishing and access management

Use Application Proxy remote access as a service to publish applications to users outside the corporate network. Help improve your cloud access management without requiring modification to your on-premises applications.

## Partner integrations for apps: on-premises and legacy authentication

Microsoft partners with various companies that deliver pre-built solutions for on-premises applications, and applications that use legacy authentication. The following diagram illustrates a user flow from sign-in to secure access to apps and data.
