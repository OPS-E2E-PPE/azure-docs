## sfctl compose list
Gets the list of compose applications created in the Service Fabric cluster.

Gets the status about the compose applications that were created or are in the process of being
        created in the Service Fabric cluster. The response includes the name, status, and other
        details about the compose application. If the applications do not fit in a page, one page of
        results is returned as well as a continuation token, which can be used to get the next page.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --continuation-token| The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results. A      continuation token with a non empty value is included in the response of      the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response.      When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set      of results. If there are no further results, then the continuation token      does not contain a value. The value of this parameter should not be URL      encoded.|
| --max-results    | The maximum number of results to be returned as part of the paged queries.      This parameter defines the upper bound on the number of results returned.      If      they do not fit in the message as per the max message size restrictions      defined in the configuration, the results returned can be less than the specified maximum results. If this parameter is zero or not specified,      the paged queries includes as much results as possible that fit in the      return message.|
| --timeout -t     | Server timeout in seconds.  Default: 60.|

### Global Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --debug          | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs.|
| --help -h        | Show this help message and exit.|
| --output -o      | Output format.  Allowed values: json, jsonc, table, tsv.  Default: json.|
| --query          | JMESPath query string. For more information and examples, see http://jmespath.org/.|
| --verbose        | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs.|

## sfctl compose remove

Deletes an existing Service Fabric compose application. An application must be created
        before it can be deleted.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
