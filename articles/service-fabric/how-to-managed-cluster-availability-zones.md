# Deploy a Service Fabric managed cluster across availability zones
Availability Zones in Azure are a high-availability offering that protects your applications and data from datacenter failures. An Availability Zone is a unique physical location equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking within an Azure region.

Service Fabric managed cluster supports deployments that span across multiple Availability Zones to provide zone resiliency. This configuration will ensure high-availability of the critical system services and your applications to protect from single-points-of-failure. Azure Availability Zones are only available in select regions. For more information, see [Azure Availability Zones Overview](../availability-zones/az-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Availability Zone spanning is only available on Standard SKU clusters.

Sample templates are available: [Service Fabric cross availability zone template](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-cluster-templates)

## Recommendations for zone resilient Azure Service Fabric managed clusters
A Service Fabric cluster distributed across Availability Zones ensures high availability of the cluster state. 

The recommended topology for managed cluster requires the resources outlined below:

* The cluster SKU must be Standard
* Primary node type should have at least nine nodes for best resiliency, but supports minimum number of six.
* Secondary node type(s) should have at least six nodes for best resiliency, but supports minimum number of three.

>[!NOTE]
>Only 3 Availability Zone deployments are supported.

>[!NOTE]
> It is not possible to do an in-place change of a managed cluster from non-spanning to a spanned cluster.

**Distribution of Service replicas across zones**:
When a service is deployed on the nodeTypes that are spanning zones, the replicas are placed to ensure they land up in separate zones. This separation is ensured as the fault domainâ€™s on the nodes present in each of these nodeTypes are configured with the zone information (i.e FD = fd:/zone1/1 etc.). For example: for five replicas or instances of a service the distribution will be 2-2-1 and runtime will try to ensure equal distribution across AZs.

**User Service Replica Configuration**:
Stateful user services deployed on the cross availability zone nodeTypes should be configured with this configuration: replica count with target = 9, min = 5. This configuration will help the service to be working even when one zone goes down since 6 replicas will be still up in the other two zones. An application upgrade in such a scenario will also go through.

**Zone down scenario**:
When a zone goes down, all the nodes in that zone will appear as down. Service replicas on these nodes will also be down. Since there are replicas in the other zones, the service continues to be responsive with primary replicas failing over to the zones which are functioning. The services will appear in warning state as the target replica count is not met and the VM count is still more than the defined min target replica size. As a result, Service Fabric load balancer will bring up replicas in the working zones to match the configured target replica count. At this point, the services will appear healthy. When the zone which was down comes back up, the load balancer will again spread all the service replicas evenly across all the zones.

## Networking Configuration
For more information, see [Configure network settings for Service Fabric managed clusters](./how-to-managed-cluster-networking.md)

## Enabling a zone resilient Azure Service Fabric managed cluster
To enable a zone resilient Azure Service Fabric managed cluster, you must include the following in the managed cluster resource definition.

* The **ZonalResiliency** property, which specifies if the cluster is zone resilient or not.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2021-05-01",
  "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters",
  "zonalResiliency": "true"
}
```

## Migrate an existing non-zone resilient cluster to Zone Resilient (Preview) 
Existing Service Fabric managed clusters which are not spanned across availability zones can now be migrated in-place to span availability zones. Supported scenarios include clusters created in regions that have three availability zones as well as clusters in regions where three availability zones are made available post-deployment.

>[!NOTE]
>Availability Zone spanning is only available on Standard SKU clusters and requires three availability zones in the region.

>[!NOTE]
>Migration to a zone resilient configuration can cause a brief loss of external connectivity through the load balancer, but will not effect cluster health. This occurs when a new Public IP needs to be created in order to make the networking resilient to Zone failures. Please plan the migration accordingly.

The following steps are required to migrate a cluster to be zone resilient:

* Use apiVersion 2021-11-01-preview or higher
* Add a new primary node type to the cluster with zones parameter in the nodetype set to ["1", "2", "3"] as show below:
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2021-11-01-preview",
  "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
  "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
  "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/', parameters('clusterName'))]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    ...
    "isPrimary": true,
    "zones": ["1", "2", "3"]
    ...
  }
}
```

* A brief period of unreachability to the cluster can occur during the step above.
* Add new secondary node type(s) with same zones parameter as required. Skip if you have no secondary node type.
* Migrate existing services from the old node types to the new ones. [Recommended using placement properties](./service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-cluster-description.md)
* Remove the old node types from the cluster using [Portal or cmdlet](./how-to-managed-cluster-modify-node-type.md). Make sure to remove old node types from your template.
* Set zonalResiliency: true in the cluster ARM template and do a deployment to mark cluster as zone resilient and ensure all new node type deployments span across availability zones.
