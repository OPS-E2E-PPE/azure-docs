# Tutorial: Deploy a Service Fabric Windows cluster into an Azure virtual network

This tutorial is part one of a series. You learn how to deploy a Service Fabric cluster running Windows into an [Azure virtual network (VNET)](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) and [network security group](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md) using PowerShell and a template. When you're finished, you have a cluster running in the cloud that you can deploy applications to.  To create a Linux cluster using Azure CLI, see [Create a secure Linux cluster on Azure](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md).

This tutorial describes a production scenario.  If you want to quickly create a smaller cluster for testing purposes, see [Create a test cluster](./scripts/service-fabric-powershell-create-secure-cluster-cert.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a VNET in Azure using PowerShell
> * Create a key vault and upload a certificate
> * Setup Azure Active Directory authentication
> * Create a secure Service Fabric cluster in Azure PowerShell
> * Secure the cluster with an X.509 certificate
> * Connect to the cluster using PowerShell
> * Remove a cluster

In this tutorial series you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a secure cluster on Azure
> * [Scale a cluster in or out](service-fabric-tutorial-scale-cluster.md)
> * [Upgrade the runtime of a cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-upgrade-cluster.md)
> * [Delete a cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-delete-cluster.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
* Install the [Service Fabric SDK and PowerShell module](service-fabric-get-started.md)
* Install the [Azure Powershell module version 4.1 or higher](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/azurerm/install-azurerm-ps)
* Review the key concepts of [Azure clusters](service-fabric-azure-clusters-overview.md)

The following procedures create a seven-node Service Fabric cluster. To calculate cost incurred by running a Service Fabric cluster in Azure use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

## Download and explore the template

Download the following Resource Manager template files:

* [azuredeploy.json][template]
* [azuredeploy.parameters.json][parameters]

This template deploys a secure cluster of seven virtual machines and three node types into a virtual network and a network security group.  Other sample templates can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-cluster-templates).  The [azuredeploy.json][template] deploys a number resources, including the following.

### Service Fabric cluster

In the **Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters** resource, a Windows cluster is configured with the following characteristics:

* three node types
* five nodes in the primary node type (configurable in the template parameters), one node each in the other two node types
* OS: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter with Containers (configurable in the template parameters)
* certificate secured (configurable in the template parameters)
* [reverse proxy](service-fabric-reverseproxy.md) is enabled
* [DNS service](service-fabric-dnsservice.md) is enabled
* [Durability level](service-fabric-cluster-capacity.md#the-durability-characteristics-of-the-cluster) of Bronze (configurable in the template parameters)
* [Reliability level](service-fabric-cluster-capacity.md#the-reliability-characteristics-of-the-cluster) of Silver (configurable in the template parameters)
* client connection endpoint: 19000 (configurable in the template parameters)
* HTTP gateway endpoint: 19080 (configurable in the template parameters)

### Azure load balancer

In the **Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers** resource, a load balancer is configured and probes and rules are setup for the following ports:

* client connection endpoint: 19000
* HTTP gateway endpoint: 19080
* application port: 80
* application port: 443
* Service Fabric reverse proxy: 19081

If any other application ports are needed, then you will need to adjust the **Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers** resource and the **Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups** resource to allow the traffic in.

### Virtual network, subnet, and network security group

The names of the virtual network, subnet, and network security group are declared in the template parameters.  Address spaces of the virtual network and subnet are also declared in the template parameters and configured in the **Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks** resource:

* virtual network address space: 172.16.0.0/20
* Service Fabric subnet address space: 172.16.2.0/23

The following inbound traffic rules are enabled in the **Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups** resource. You can change the port values by changing the template variables.

* ClientConnectionEndpoint (TCP): 19000
* HttpGatewayEndpoint (HTTP/TCP): 19080
* SMB : 445
* Internodecommunication - 1025, 1026, 1027
* Ephemeral port range – 49152 to 65534 (need a min of 256 ports )
* Ports for application use: 80 and 443
* Application port range – 49152 to 65534 (used for service to service communication and unlike are not opened on the Load balancer )
* Block all other ports

If any other application ports are needed, then you will need to adjust the **Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers** resource and the **Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups** resource to allow the traffic in.

### Windows Defender
By default, [Windows Defender Antivirus](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-2016) is installed and functional on Windows Server 2016. The user interface is installed by default on some SKUs, but is not required.  For each node type/VM scale set declared in the template, the [Azure VM Antimalware extension](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/iaas-antimalware-windows) is used to exclude the Service Fabric directories and processes:

```json
{
"name": "[concat('VMIaaSAntimalware','_vmNodeType0Name')]",
"properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Security",
        "type": "IaaSAntimalware",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.5",
        "settings": {
        "AntimalwareEnabled": "true",
        "Exclusions": {
                "Paths": "D:\\SvcFab;D:\\SvcFab\\Log;C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Service Fabric",
                "Processes": "Fabric.exe;FabricHost.exe;FabricInstallerService.exe;FabricSetup.exe;FabricDeployer.exe;ImageBuilder.exe;FabricGateway.exe;FabricDCA.exe;FabricFAS.exe;FabricUOS.exe;FabricRM.exe;FileStoreService.exe"
        },
        "RealtimeProtectionEnabled": "true",
        "ScheduledScanSettings": {
                "isEnabled": "true",
                "scanType": "Quick",
                "day": "7",
                "time": "120"
        }
        },
        "protectedSettings": null
}
}
```

## Set template parameters

The [azuredeploy.parameters.json][parameters] parameters file declares many values used to deploy the cluster and associated resources. Some of the parameters that you might need to modify for your deployment:

|Parameter|Example value|Notes|
|---|---||
|adminUserName|vmadmin| Admin username for the cluster VMs.[Username requirements for VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-username-requirements-when-creating-a-vm) |
|adminPassword|Password#1234| Admin password for the cluster VMs. [Password requirements for VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm)|
|clusterName|mysfcluster123| Name of the cluster. Can contain letters and numbers only. Length can be between 3 and 23 characters.|
|location|southcentralus| Location of the cluster. |
|certificateThumbprint|| <p>Value should be empty if creating a self-signed certificate or providing a certificate file.</p><p>To use an existing certificate previously uploaded to a key vault, fill in the certificate SHA1 thumbprint value. For example, "6190390162C988701DB5676EB81083EA608DCCF3"</p>. |
|certificateUrlValue|| <p>Value should be empty if creating a self-signed certificate or providing a certificate file. </p><p>To use an existing certificate previously uploaded to a key vault, fill in the certificate URL. For example, "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net:443/secrets/mycertificate/02bea722c9ef4009a76c5052bcbf8346".</p>|
|sourceVaultValue||<p>Value should be empty if creating a self-signed certificate or providing a certificate file.</p><p>To use an existing certificate previously uploaded to a key vault, fill in the source vault value. For example, "/subscriptions/333cc2c84-12fa-5778-bd71-c71c07bf873f/resourceGroups/MyTestRG/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/MYKEYVAULT".</p>|

## Set up Azure Active Directory client authentication
For Service Fabric clusters deployed in a public network hosted on Azure, the recommendation for client-to-node mutual authentication is:
* Use Azure Active Directory for client identity
* A certificate for server identity and SSL encryption of http communication

Setting up Azure AD to authenticate clients for a Service Fabric cluster must be done before [creating the cluster](#createvaultandcert).  Azure AD enables organizations (known as tenants) to manage user access to applications. 

A Service Fabric cluster offers several entry points to its management functionality, including the web-based [Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md) and [Visual Studio](service-fabric-manage-application-in-visual-studio.md). As a result, you create two Azure AD applications to control access to the cluster: one web application and one native application.  After the applications are created, you assign users to read-only and admin roles.

> [!NOTE]
> You must complete the following steps before you create the cluster. Because the scripts expect cluster names and endpoints, the values should be planned and not values that you have already created.

In this article, we assume that you have already created a tenant. If you have not, start by reading [How to get an Azure Active Directory tenant](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).

To simplify some of the steps involved in configuring Azure AD with a Service Fabric cluster, we have created a set of Windows PowerShell scripts. [Download the scripts](https://github.com/robotechredmond/Azure-PowerShell-Snippets/tree/master/MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric-AADHelpers/AADTool) to your computer.

### Create Azure AD applications and assign users to roles
Create two Azure AD applications to control access to the cluster: one web application and one native application. After you have created the applications to represent your cluster, assign your users to the [roles supported by Service Fabric](service-fabric-cluster-security-roles.md): read-only and admin.

Run `SetupApplications.ps1`, and provide the tenant ID, cluster name, and web application reply URL as parameters.  Also specify usernames and passwords for the users.  For example:

```PowerShell
$Configobj = .\SetupApplications.ps1 -TenantId '<MyTenantID>' -ClusterName 'mysftestcluster' -WebApplicationReplyUrl 'https://mysftestcluster.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/index.html' -AddResourceAccess
.\SetupUser.ps1 -ConfigObj $Configobj -UserName 'TestUser' -Password 'P@ssword!123'
.\SetupUser.ps1 -ConfigObj $Configobj -UserName 'TestAdmin' -Password 'P@ssword!123' -IsAdmin
```

> [!NOTE]
> For national clouds (for example Azure Government, Azure China, Azure Germany), you should also specify the `-Location` parameter.

You can find your *TenantId*, or directory ID, in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Azure Active Directory -> Properties** and copy the the **Directory ID** value.

*ClusterName* is used to prefix the Azure AD applications that are created by the script. It does not need to match the actual cluster name exactly. It is intended only to make it easier to map Azure AD artifacts to the Service Fabric cluster that they're being used with.

*WebApplicationReplyUrl* is the default endpoint that Azure AD returns to your users after they finish signing in. Set this endpoint as the Service Fabric Explorer endpoint for your cluster, which by default is:

https://&lt;cluster_domain&gt;:19080/Explorer

You are prompted to sign in to an account that has administrative privileges for the Azure AD tenant. After you sign in, the script creates the web and native applications to represent your Service Fabric cluster. If you look at the tenant's applications in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you should see two new entries:

   * *ClusterName*\_Cluster
   * *ClusterName*\_Client

The script prints the JSON required by the Azure Resource Manager template when you create the cluster, so it's a good idea to keep the PowerShell window open.

```json
"azureActiveDirectory": {
  "tenantId":"<guid>",
  "clusterApplication":"<guid>",
  "clientApplication":"<guid>"
},
```

### Add Azure AD configuration to use Azure AD for client access
In the [azuredeploy.json][template], configure Azure AD in the **Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters** section.  Add parameters for the tenant ID, cluster application ID, and client application ID.  

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    ...

    "aadTenantId": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "0e3d2646-78b3-4711-b8be-74a381d9890c"
    },
    "aadClusterApplicationId": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "cb147d34-b0b9-4e77-81d6-420fef0c4180"
    },
    "aadClientApplicationId": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "7a8f3b37-cc40-45cc-9b8f-57b8919ea461"
    }
  },

...

{
  "apiVersion": "2018-02-01",
  "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters",
  "name": "[parameters('clusterName')]",
  ...
  "properties": {
    ...
    "azureActiveDirectory": {
      "tenantId": "[parameters('aadTenantId')]",
      "clusterApplication": "[parameters('aadClusterApplicationId')]",
      "clientApplication": "[parameters('aadClientApplicationId')]"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

Add the parameter values in the [azuredeploy.parameters.json][parameters] parameters file.  For example:

```json
"aadTenantId": {
"value": "0e3d2646-78b3-4711-b8be-74a381d9890c"
},
"aadClusterApplicationId": {
"value": "cb147d34-b0b9-4e77-81d6-420fef0c4180"
},
"aadClientApplicationId": {
"value": "7a8f3b37-cc40-45cc-9b8f-57b8919ea461"
}
```

## Deploy the virtual network and cluster

Next, set up the network topology and deploy the Service Fabric cluster. The [azuredeploy.json][template] Resource Manager template creates a virtual network (VNET) and also a subnet and network security group (NSG) for Service Fabric. The template also deploys a cluster with certificate security enabled.  For production clusters, use a certificate from a certificate authority (CA) as the cluster certificate. A self-signed certificate can be used to secure test clusters.

The template in this article deploys a cluster that uses the certificate thumbprint to identify the cluster certificate.  No two certificates can have the same thumbprint, which makes certificate management more difficult. Switching a deployed cluster from using certificate thumbprints to using certificate common names makes certificate management much simpler.  To learn how to update the cluster to use certificate common names for certificate management, read [change cluster to certificate common name management](service-fabric-cluster-change-cert-thumbprint-to-cn.md).

### Create a cluster using an existing certificate

The following script uses the [New-AzureRmServiceFabricCluster](/powershell/module/azurerm.servicefabric/New-AzureRmServiceFabricCluster) cmdlet and a template to deploy a new cluster in Azure. The cmdlet also creates a new key vault in Azure and uploads your certificate.

```powershell
# Variables.
$groupname = "sfclustertutorialgroup"
$clusterloc="southcentralus"  # must match the location parameter in the template
$templatepath="C:\temp\cluster"

$certpwd="q6D7nN%6ck@6" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$clustername = "mysfcluster123"  # must match the clusterName parameter in the template
$vaultname = "clusterkeyvault123"
$vaultgroupname="clusterkeyvaultgroup123"
$subname="$clustername.$clusterloc.cloudapp.azure.com"

# sign in to your Azure account and select your subscription
Connect-AzureRmAccount
Get-AzureRmSubscription
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <guid>

# Create a new resource group for your deployment and give it a name and a location.
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $groupname -Location $clusterloc

# Create the Service Fabric cluster.
New-AzureRmServiceFabricCluster  -ResourceGroupName $groupname -TemplateFile "$templatepath\azuredeploy.json" `
-ParameterFile "$templatepath\azuredeploy.parameters.json" -CertificatePassword $certpwd `
-KeyVaultName $vaultname -KeyVaultResourceGroupName $vaultgroupname -CertificateFile $certpath
```

### Create a cluster using a new, self-signed certificate

The following script uses the [New-AzureRmServiceFabricCluster](/powershell/module/azurerm.servicefabric/New-AzureRmServiceFabricCluster) cmdlet and a template to deploy a new cluster in Azure. The cmdlet also creates a new key vault in Azure, adds a new self-signed certificate to the key vault, and downloads the certificate file locally.

```powershell
# Variables.
$groupname = "sfclustertutorialgroup"
$clusterloc="southcentralus"  # must match the location parameter in the template
$templatepath="C:\temp\cluster"

$certpwd="q6D7nN%6ck@6" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$certfolder="c:\mycertificates\"
$clustername = "mysfcluster123"
$vaultname = "clusterkeyvault123"
$vaultgroupname="clusterkeyvaultgroup123"
$subname="$clustername.$clusterloc.cloudapp.azure.com"

# sign in to your Azure account and select your subscription
Connect-AzureRmAccount
Get-AzureRmSubscription
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <guid>

# Create a new resource group for your deployment and give it a name and a location.
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $groupname -Location $clusterloc

# Create the Service Fabric cluster.
New-AzureRmServiceFabricCluster  -ResourceGroupName $groupname -TemplateFile "$templatepath\azuredeploy.json" `
-ParameterFile "$templatepath\azuredeploy.parameters.json" -CertificatePassword $certpwd `
-CertificateOutputFolder $certfolder -KeyVaultName $vaultname -KeyVaultResourceGroupName $vaultgroupname -CertificateSubjectName $subname

```

## Connect to the secure cluster

Connect to the cluster using the Service Fabric PowerShell module installed with the Service Fabric SDK.  First, install the certificate into the Personal (My) store of the current user on your computer.  Run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
$certpwd="q6D7nN%6ck@6" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
Import-PfxCertificate -Exportable -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My `
        -FilePath C:\mycertificates\mysfcluster20170531104310.pfx `
        -Password $certpwd
```

You are now ready to connect to your secure cluster.

The **Service Fabric** PowerShell module provides many cmdlets for managing Service Fabric clusters, applications, and services.  Use the [Connect-ServiceFabricCluster](/powershell/module/servicefabric/connect-servicefabriccluster) cmdlet to connect to the secure cluster. The certificate SHA1 thumbprint and connection endpoint details are found in the output from the previous step.

If you previously set up AAD client authentication, run the following: 
```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint mysfcluster123.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000 `
        -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
        -AzureActiveDirectory `
        -ServerCertThumbprint C4C1E541AD512B8065280292A8BA6079C3F26F10
```

If you did not setup AAD client authentication, run the following:
```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint mysfcluster123.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000 `
          -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
          -X509Credential -ServerCertThumbprint C4C1E541AD512B8065280292A8BA6079C3F26F10 `
          -FindType FindByThumbprint -FindValue C4C1E541AD512B8065280292A8BA6079C3F26F10 `
          -StoreLocation CurrentUser -StoreName My
```

Check that you are connected and the cluster is healthy using the [Get-ServiceFabricClusterHealth](/powershell/module/servicefabric/get-servicefabricclusterhealth) cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-ServiceFabricClusterHealth
```

## Clean up resources

The other articles in this tutorial series use the cluster you just created. If you're not immediately moving on to the next article, you might want to [delete the cluster](service-fabric-cluster-delete.md) to avoid incurring charges.
