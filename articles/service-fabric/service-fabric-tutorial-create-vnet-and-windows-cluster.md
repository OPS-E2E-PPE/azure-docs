# Deploy a secure Service Fabric Windows cluster into an Azure virtual network
This tutorial is part one of a series. You will learn how to create a Service Fabric cluster (Windows) running in Azure and deploy it into an existing virtual network (VNET) and subnet. When you're finished, you have a cluster running in the cloud that you can deploy applications to.  To create a Linux cluster, see [Create a secure Linux cluster on Azure using a template](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a VNET in Azure using a template
> * Create a key vault and upload a certificate
> * Create a secure Service Fabric cluster in Azure using a template
> * Secure the cluster with an X.509 certificate
> * Connect to the cluster using PowerShell
> * Remove a cluster

In this tutorial series you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a secure cluster on Azure using a template
> * [Deploy API Management with Service Fabric](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-api-management.md)

## Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial:
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
- Install the [Service Fabric SDK and PowerShell module](service-fabric-get-started.md)
- Install the [Azure Powershell module version 4.1 or higher](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps)

The following procedures create a five-node Service Fabric cluster. The cluster is secured by a self-signed certificate placed in a key vault. 

To calculate cost incurred by running a Service Fabric cluster in Azure use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).
For more information on creating Service Fabric clusters, see [Create a Service Fabric cluster by using Azure Resource Manager](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm.md).

## Sign-in to Azure and select your subscription
This guide uses Azure PowerShell. When you start a new PowerShell session, sign in to your Azure account and select your subscription before you execute Azure commands.
 
Run the following script to sign in to your Azure account select your subscription:

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
Get-AzureRmSubscription
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <guid>
```

## Create a resource group
Create a new resource group for your deployment and give it a name and a location.

```powershell
$ResourceGroupName = "sfclustertutorialgroup"
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroupName -Location centralus
```

## Deploy the network topology
Next, set up the network topology to which API Management and the Service Fabric cluster will be deployed. The [network.json][network-arm] Resource Manager template is configured to create a virtual network (VNET) and also a subnet and network security group (NSG) for Service Fabric and a subnet and NSG for API Management. Learn more about VNETs, subnets, and NSGs [here](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

The [network.parameters.json][network-parameters-arm] parameters file contains the names of the subnets and NSGs that Service Fabric and API Management deploy to.  API Management is deployed in the [following tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-api-management.md). For this guide, the parameter values do not need to be changed. The Service Fabric Resource Manager templates use these values.  If the values are modified here, you must modify them in the other Resource Manager templates used in this tutorial and the [Deploy API Management tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-api-management.md). 

Download the following Resource Manager template and parameters file:
- [network.json][network-arm]
- [network.parameters.json][network-parameters-arm]

Use the following PowerShell command to deploy the Resource Manager template and parameter files for the network setup:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -TemplateFile .\network.json -TemplateParameterFile .\network.parameters.json -Verbose
```

## Create a key vault and upload a certificate
The Service Fabric cluster Resource Manager template in the next step is configured to create a secure cluster with certificate security. The certificate is used to secure node-to-node communication for your cluster and to manage user access to your Service Fabric cluster. API Management also uses this certificate to access the Service Fabric Naming Service for service discovery. This requires having a certificate in Key Vault for cluster security.

The following script creates a key vault in Azure, creates a self-signed certificate, and uploads the certificate to the key vault.  If you want to use an existing certificate, set **$CreateSelfSignedCertificate** to "$false" and specify the location in **$ExistingPfxFilePath**.

```powershell
$VaultResourceGroupName = 'ryanwikeyvaultgroup'
$VaultName= 'ryanwikeyvault'
$Location = "westus"
$CertificateName = "ryanwicertificate1"
$Password = 'mypa$$word!'
$DnsName = "www.mycluster.westus.mydomain.com" #The certificate's subject name must match the domain used to access the Service Fabric cluster.
$OutputPath = "C:\MyCertificates" # location where you want the .PFX to be stored
$CreateSelfSignedCertificate = $true
$ExistingPfxFilePath = 'C:\MyCertificates\ryanwicertificate1.pfx'

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

Write-Host "Switching context to SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId"
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId | Out-Null

# New-AzureRmResourceGroup is idempotent as long as the location matches
Write-Host "Ensuring ResourceGroup $VaultResourceGroupName in $Location"
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $VaultResourceGroupName -Location $Location -Force | Out-Null
$resourceId = $null

try
{
    $existingKeyVault = Get-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName $VaultName -ResourceGroupName $VaultResourceGroupName
    $resourceId = $existingKeyVault.ResourceId

    Write-Host "Using existing vault $VaultName in $($existingKeyVault.Location)"
}
catch
{
}

if(!$existingKeyVault)
{
    Write-Host "Creating new vault $VaultName in $location"
    $newKeyVault = New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName $VaultName -ResourceGroupName $VaultResourceGroupName -Location $Location -EnabledForDeployment
    $resourceId = $newKeyVault.ResourceId
}

if($CreateSelfSignedCertificate)
{
    $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $password -AsPlainText -Force

    $NewPfxFilePath = Join-Path $OutputPath $($CertificateName+".pfx")

    Write-Host "Creating new self signed certificate at $NewPfxFilePath"
    
    ## Changes to PSPKI version 3.5.2 New-SelfSignedCertificate replaced by New-SelfSignedCertificateEx
    $PspkiVersion = (Get-Module PSPKI).Version
    if($PSPKIVersion.Major -ieq 3 -And $PspkiVersion.Minor -ieq 2 -And $PspkiVersion.Build -ieq 5) {
        New-SelfsignedCertificateEx -Subject "CN=$DnsName" -EKU "Server Authentication", "Client authentication" -KeyUsage "KeyEncipherment, DigitalSignature" -Path $NewPfxFilePath -Password $securePassword -Exportable
    }
    else {
        New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -DnsName $DnsName | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath $NewPfxFilePath -Password $securePassword | Out-Null
    }

    $ExistingPfxFilePath = $NewPfxFilePath
}

Write-Host "Reading pfx file from $ExistingPfxFilePath"
$cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 $ExistingPfxFilePath, $Password

$bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($ExistingPfxFilePath)
$base64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)

$jsonBlob = @{
   data = $base64
   dataType = 'pfx'
   password = $Password
   } | ConvertTo-Json

    $contentbytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($jsonBlob)
    $content = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($contentbytes)

    $secretValue = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $content -AsPlainText -Force

Write-Host "Writing secret to $CertificateName in vault $VaultName"
$secret = Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $VaultName -Name $CertificateName -SecretValue $secretValue

$output = @{};
$output.SourceVault = $resourceId;
$output.CertificateURL = $secret.Id;
$output.CertificateThumbprint = $cert.Thumbprint;

Write-Host "Source vault: " $output.SourceVault
Write-Host "Certificate URL: " $output.CertificateURL
Write-Host "Certificate Thumbprint: " $output.CertificateThumbprint
```

## Deploy the Service Fabric cluster
Once the network resources have finished deploying and you've uploaded a certificate to a key vault, the next step is to deploy a Service Fabric cluster to the VNET in the subnet and NSG designated for the Service Fabric cluster. For this tutorial, the Service Fabric Resource Manager template is pre-configured to use the names of the VNET, subnet, and NSG that you set up in a previous step.

Download the following Resource Manager template and parameters file:
- [cluster.json][cluster-arm]
- [cluster.parameters.json][cluster-parameters-arm]

Fill in the empty parameters in the `cluster.parameters.json` file for your deployment, including the [Key Vault information](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm.md#set-up-a-key-vault) for your cluster certificate.

Use the following PowerShell command to deploy the Resource Manager template and parameter files to create the Service Fabric cluster:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -TemplateFile .\cluster.json -TemplateParameterFile .\cluster.parameters.json -Verbose
```

## Modify the certificate & access Service Fabric Explorer 

1. Double-click the certificate to open the Certificate Import Wizard.

2. Use default settings, but make sure to check the **Mark this key as exportable.** check box, in the **private key protection** step. Visual Studio needs to export the certificate when configuring Azure Container Registry to Service Fabric Cluster authentication later in this tutorial.

3. You can now open Service Fabric Explorer in a browser. To do so, navigate to the **ManagementEndpoint** URL for your cluster using a web browser, and select the certificate that was saved on your machine.

>[!NOTE]
>When opening Service Fabric Explorer, you see a certificate error, as you are using a self-signed certificate. In Edge, you have to click *Details* and then the *Go on to the webpage* link. In Chrome, you have to click *Advanced* and then the *proceed* link.

>[!NOTE]
>If the cluster creation fails, you can always rerun the command, which updates the resources already deployed. If a certificate was created as part of the failed deployment, a new one is generated. To troubleshoot cluster creation, see [Create a Service Fabric cluster by using Azure Resource Manager](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm.md).

## Connect to the secure cluster
Connect to the cluster using the Service Fabric PowerShell module installed with the Service Fabric SDK.  First, install the certificate into the Personal (My) store of the current user on your computer.  Run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
$certpwd="Password#1234" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
Import-PfxCertificate -Exportable -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My `
        -FilePath C:\mycertificates\mysfcluster20170531104310.pfx `
        -Password $certpwd
```

You are now ready to connect to your secure cluster.

The **Service Fabric** PowerShell module provides many cmdlets for managing Service Fabric clusters, applications, and services.  Use the [Connect-ServiceFabricCluster](/powershell/module/servicefabric/connect-servicefabriccluster) cmdlet to connect to the secure cluster. The certificate thumbprint and connection endpoint details are found in the output from a previous step.

```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint mysfcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000 `
          -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
          -X509Credential -ServerCertThumbprint C4C1E541AD512B8065280292A8BA6079C3F26F10 `
          -FindType FindByThumbprint -FindValue C4C1E541AD512B8065280292A8BA6079C3F26F10 `
          -StoreLocation CurrentUser -StoreName My
```

Check that you are connected and the cluster is healthy using the [Get-ServiceFabricClusterHealth](/powershell/module/servicefabric/get-servicefabricclusterhealth) cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-ServiceFabricClusterHealth
```

```azurecli
sfctl cluster health
```

## Clean up resources

A cluster is made up of other Azure resources in addition to the cluster resource itself. The simplest way to delete the cluster and all the resources it consumes is to delete the resource group.

Log in to Azure and select the subscription ID with which you want to remove the cluster.  You can find your subscription ID by logging in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). Delete the resource group and all the cluster resources using the [Remove-AzureRMResourceGroup cmdlet](/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup).

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "Subcription ID"

$ResourceGroupName = "sfclustertutorialgroup"
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroupName -Force
```
