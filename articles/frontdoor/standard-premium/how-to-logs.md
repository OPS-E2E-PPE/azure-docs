# Azure Front Door logs

Azure Front Door provides different logging to help you track, monitor, and debug your Front Door. 

* Access logs have detailed information about every request that AFD receives and help you analyze and monitor access patterns, and debug issues. 
* Activity logs provide visibility into the operations done on Azure resources.  
* Health probe logs provide the logs for every failed probe to your origin. 
* Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs provide detailed information of requests that gets logged through either detection or prevention mode of an Azure Front Door endpoint. A custom domain that gets configured with WAF can also be viewed through these logs. For more information on WAF logs, see [Azure Web Application Firewall monitoring and logging](../../web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-monitor.md#waf-logs).

Access logs, health probe logs and WAF logs aren't enabled by default. Use the steps below to enable logging. Activity log entries are collected by default, and you can view them in the Azure portal. Logs can have delays up to a few minutes. 

You have three options for storing your logs: 

* **Storage account:** Storage accounts are best used for scenarios when logs are stored for a longer duration and reviewed when needed. 
* **Event hubs:** Event hubs are a great option for integrating with other security information and event management (SIEM) tools or external data stores. For example: Splunk/DataDog/Sumo. 
* **Azure Log Analytics:** Azure Log Analytics in Azure Monitor is best used for general real-time monitoring and analysis of Azure Front Door performance.

## Access log

Azure Front Door currently provides individual API requests with each entry having the following schema and logged in JSON format as shown below. 

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------| 
| TrackingReference | The unique reference string that identifies a request served by AFD, also sent as X-Azure-Ref header to the client. Required for searching details in the access logs for a specific request. |
| Time | The date and time when the AFD edge delivered requested contents to client (in UTC). |
| HttpMethod | HTTP method used by the request: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, or PUT. |
| HttpVersion | The HTTP version that the viewer specified in the request. |
| RequestUri | URI of the received request. This field is a full scheme, port, domain, path, and query string |
| HostName | The host name in the request from client. If you enable custom domains and have wildcard domain (*.contoso.com), hostname is a.contoso.com. if you use Azure Front Door domain (contoso.azurefd.net), hostname is contoso.azurefd.net. |
| RequestBytes | The size of the HTTP request message in bytes, including the request headers and the request body. The number of bytes of data that the viewer included in the request, including headers. |
| ResponseBytes | Bytes sent by the backend server as the response. |
| UserAgent | The browser type that the client used. |
| ClientIp | The IP address of the client that made the original request. If there was an X-Forwarded-For header in the request, then the Client IP is picked from the same. |
| SocketIp | The IP address of the direct connection to AFD edge. If the client used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of SocketIp is the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. |
| timeTaken | The length of time from the time AFD edge server receives a client's request to the time that AFD sends the last byte of response to client,  in milliseconds. This field doesn't take into account network latency and TCP buffering. |
| RequestProtocol | The protocol that the client specified in the request: HTTP, HTTPS. |
| SecurityProtocol | The TLS/SSL protocol version used by the request or null if no encryption. Possible values include: SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 |
| SecurityCipher | When the value for Request Protocol is HTTPS, this field indicates the TLS/SSL cipher negotiated by the client and AFD for encryption. |
| Endpoint | The domain name of AFD endpoint, for example, contoso.z01.azurefd.net |

| Pop | The edge pop, which responded to the user request.  |
| Cache Status | Provides the status code of how the request gets handled by the CDN service when it comes to caching. Possible values are:<ul><li>`HIT` and `REMOTE_HIT`: The HTTP request was served from the Front Door cache.</li><li>`MISS`: The HTTP request was served from the origin.</li><li> `PARTIAL_HIT`: Some of the bytes from a request were served from the Front Door cache, and some of the bytes were served from origin. This status occurs in [object chunking](../front-door-caching.md#delivery-of-large-files) scenarios.</li><li>`CACHE_NOCONFIG`: Request was forwarded without caching settings, including bypass scenario.</li><li>`PRIVATE_NOSTORE`: No cache configured in caching settings by customers.</li><li>`N/A`: The request was denied by a signed URL or the rules engine.</li></ul> |
| MatchedRulesSetName | The names of the rules that were processed. |
| RouteName | The name of the route that the request matched. |
| ClientPort | The IP port of the client that made the request. |
| Referrer | The URL of the site that originated the request. |
| TimeToFirstByte | The length of time in milliseconds from AFD receives the request to the time the first byte gets sent to client, as measured on Azure Front Door. This property doesn't measure the client data. |
| ErrorInfo | This field provides detailed info of the error token for each response. Possible values are:<ul><li>`NoError`: Indicates no error was found.</li><li>`CertificateError`: Generic SSL certificate error.</li><li>`CertificateNameCheckFailed`: The host name in the SSL certificate is invalid or doesn't match.</li><li>`ClientDisconnected`: Request failure because of client network connection.</li><li>`ClientGeoBlocked`: The client was blocked due geographical location of the IP.</li><li>`UnspecifiedClientError`: Generic client error.</li><li>`InvalidRequest`: Invalid request.

For more information, see [Caching with Azure Front Door](../front-door-caching.md#delivery-of-large-files) |

## Health Probe Log

Health probe logs provide logging for every failed probe to help you diagnose your origin. The logs will provide you information that you can use to bring the origin back to service. Some scenarios this log can be useful for are:

* You noticed Azure Front Door traffic was sent to some of the origins. For example, only three out of four origins receiving traffic. You want to know if the origins are receiving probes and if not the reason for the failure.  

* You noticed the origin health % is lower than expected and want to know which origin failed and the reason of the failure.

### Health probe log properties

Each health probe log has the following schema.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| HealthProbeId  | A unique ID to identify the request. |
| Time | Probe complete time |
| HttpMethod | HTTP method used by the health probe request. Values include GET and HEAD, based on health probe configurations. |
| Result | Status of health probe to origin, value includes success, and other error text. |
| HttpStatusCode  | The HTTP status code returned from the origin. |
| ProbeURL (target) | The full URL of the origin where requests are being sent. Composed of the scheme, host header, path, and query string. |
| OriginName  | The origin where requests are being sent. This field helps locate origins of interest if origin is configured to FDQN. |
| POP | The edge pop, which sent out the probe request. |
| Origin IP | Target origin IP. This field is useful in locating origins of interest if you configure origin using FDQN. |
| TotalLatency | The time from AFDX edge sends the request to origin to the time origin sends the last response to AFDX edge. |
| ConnectionLatency| Duration Time spent on setting up the TCP connection to send the HTTP Probe request to origin. | 
| DNSResolution Latency | Duration Time spent on DNS resolution if the origin is configured to be an FDQN instead of IP. N/A if the origin is configured to IP. |

The following example shows a health probe log entry, in JSON format.
