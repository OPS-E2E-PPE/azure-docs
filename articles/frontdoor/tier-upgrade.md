# Upgrade from Azure Front Door Standard to Premium tier (Preview)

Azure Front Door supports upgrading from Standard to Premium tier for more advanced capabilities and an increase in quota limits. The upgrade won't cause any downtime to your services or applications. For more information about the differences between Standard and Premium tier, see [Tier comparison](standard-premium/tier-comparison.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upgrading Azure Front Door tier is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article will walk you through how to perform the tier upgrade on the configuration page of a Front Door Standard profile. Once upgraded, you'll be charge for the Azure Front Door Premium monthly base fee at an hourly rate.

1. If you have WAF policies associated to the Front Door Standard profile, then you'll be taken to the *Upgrade WAF policies* page. On this page, you'll decide whether you want to make copies of the WAF policies or use an existing premium WAF policy. You can also change the name of the new WAF policy copy during this step.

    > To use managed WAF rules for the new premium WAF policy copies, you'll need to manually enable them after the upgrade.

1. Select **Upgrade** once you're done setting up the WAF policies. Select **Yes** to confirm you would like to proceed with the upgrade.

1. The upgrade process will create new premium WAF policy copies and associate them to the upgraded Front Door profile. The upgrade can take a few minutes to complete depending on the complexity of your Front Door profile.
