# Virtual network configuration for an Azure-SSIS integration runtime

Set up your virtual network to meet these requirements: 

- Make sure that `Microsoft.Batch` is a registered provider under the subscription of your virtual network subnet that hosts the Azure-SSIS IR. If you use a classic virtual network, also join `MicrosoftAzureBatch` to the Classic Virtual Machine Contributor role for that virtual network. 

- Make sure you have the required permissions. For more information, see [Set up permissions](#perms).

- Select the proper subnet to host the Azure-SSIS IR. For more information, see [Select the subnet](#subnet). 

- If you bring your own public IP addresses for the Azure-SSIS IR, see [Select the static public IP addresses](#publicIP)

- If you use your own Domain Name System (DNS) server on the virtual network, see [Set up the DNS server](#dns_server). 

- If you use a network security group (NSG) on the subnet, see [Set up an NSG](#nsg). 

- If you use Azure ExpressRoute or a user-defined route (UDR), see [Use Azure ExpressRoute or a UDR](#route). 

- Make sure the virtual network's resource group (or the public IP addresses' resource group if you bring your own public IP addresses) can create and delete certain Azure network resources. For more information, see [Set up the resource group](#resource-group). 

- If you customize your Azure-SSIS IR as described in [Custom setup for Azure-SSIS IR](./how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup.md), our internal process to manage its nodes will consume private IP addresses from a predefined range of 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255. Consequently, please make sure that the private IP address ranges of your virtual or on-premises networks don't collide with this range.

This diagram shows the required connections for your Azure-SSIS IR:

:::image type="content" source="media/join-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-virtual-network/azure-ssis-ir.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the required connections for your Azure-SSIS IR.":::

## <a name="perms"></a> Set up permissions

The user who creates the Azure-SSIS IR must have the following permissions:

- If you're joining your SSIS IR to an Azure Resource Manager virtual network, you have two options:

  - Use the built-in Network Contributor role. This role comes with the _Microsoft.Network/\*_ permission, which has a much larger scope than necessary.

  - Create a custom role that includes only the necessary _Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/\*/join/action_ permission. If you also want to bring your own public IP addresses for Azure-SSIS IR while joining it to an Azure Resource Manager virtual network, please also include _Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/*/join/action_ permission in the role.

- If you're joining your SSIS IR to a classic virtual network, we recommend that you use the built-in Classic Virtual Machine Contributor role. Otherwise you have to define a custom role that includes the permission to join the virtual network.

## <a name="subnet"></a> Select the subnet

As you choose a subnet: 

- Don't select the GatewaySubnet to deploy an Azure-SSIS IR. It's dedicated for virtual network gateways. 

- Ensure that the subnet you select has enough available address space for the Azure-SSIS IR to use. Leave available IP addresses for at least two times the IR node number. Azure reserves some IP addresses within each subnet. These addresses can't be used. The first and last IP addresses of the subnets are reserved for protocol conformance, and three more addresses are used for Azure services. For more information, see [Are there any restrictions on using IP addresses within these subnets?](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq.md#are-there-any-restrictions-on-using-ip-addresses-within-these-subnets) 

- Donâ€™t use a subnet that is exclusively occupied by other Azure services (for example, SQL Database SQL Managed Instance, App Service, and so on). 

## <a name="publicIP"></a>Select the static public IP addresses

If you want to bring your own static public IP addresses for Azure-SSIS IR while joining it to a virtual network, make sure they meet the following requirements:

- Exactly two unused ones that are not already associated with other Azure resources should be provided. The extra one will be used when we periodically upgrade your Azure-SSIS IR. Note that one public IP address cannot be shared among your active Azure-SSIS IRs.

- They should both be static ones of standard type. Refer to [SKUs of Public IP Address](../virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses.md#sku) for more details.

- They should both have a DNS name. If you have not provided a DNS name when creating them, you can do so on Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/ssis-integration-runtime-management-troubleshoot/setup-publicipdns-name.png" alt-text="Azure-SSIS IR":::

- They and the virtual network should be under the same subscription and in the same region.

## <a name="dns_server"></a> Set up the DNS server 
If you need to use your own DNS server in a virtual network joined by your Azure-SSIS IR to resolve your private host name, make sure it can also resolve global Azure host names (for example, an Azure Storage blob named `<your storage account>.blob.core.windows.net`). 

One recommended approach is below: 

-   Configure the custom DNS to forward requests to Azure DNS. You can forward unresolved DNS records to the IP address of the Azure recursive resolvers (168.63.129.16) on your own DNS server. 

For more information, see [Name resolution that uses your own DNS server](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-that-uses-your-own-dns-server). 

> [!NOTE]
> Please use a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for your private host name (for example, use `<your_private_server>.contoso.com` instead of `<your_private_server>`). Alternatively, you can use a standard custom setup on your Azure-SSIS IR to automatically append your own DNS suffix (for example `contoso.com`) to any unqualified single label domain name and turn it into an FQDN before using it in DNS queries, see [standard custom setup samples](./how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup.md#standard-custom-setup-samples). 

## <a name="nsg"></a> Set up an NSG
If you need to implement an NSG for the subnet used by your Azure-SSIS IR, allow inbound and outbound traffic through the following ports: 

-   **Inbound requirement of Azure-SSIS IR**

| Direction | Transport protocol | Source | Source port range | Destination | Destination port range | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inbound | TCP | BatchNodeManagement | * | VirtualNetwork | 29876, 29877 (if you join the IR to a Resource Manager virtual network) <br/><br/>10100, 20100, 30100 (if you join the IR to a classic virtual network)| The Data Factory service uses these ports to communicate with the nodes of your Azure-SSIS IR in the virtual network. <br/><br/> Whether or not you create a subnet-level NSG, Data Factory always configures an NSG at the level of the network interface cards (NICs) attached to the virtual machines that host the Azure-SSIS IR. Only inbound traffic from Data Factory IP addresses on the specified ports is allowed by that NIC-level NSG. Even if you open these ports to internet traffic at the subnet level, traffic from IP addresses that aren't Data Factory IP addresses is blocked at the NIC level. |
| Inbound | TCP | CorpNetSaw | * | VirtualNetwork | 3389 | (Optional) This rule is only required when Microsoft supporter ask customer to open for advanced troubleshooting, and can be closed right after troubleshooting. **CorpNetSaw** service tag permits only secure access workstations on the Microsoft corporate network to use remote desktop. And this service tag can't be selected from portal and is only available via Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. <br/><br/> At NIC level NSG, port 3389 is open by default and we allow you to control port 3389 at subnet level NSG, meanwhile Azure-SSIS IR has disallowed port 3389 outbound by default at windows firewall rule on each IR node for protection. |
||||||||

-   **Outbound requirement of Azure-SSIS IR**

| Direction | Transport protocol | Source | Source port range | Destination | Destination port range | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outbound | TCP | VirtualNetwork | * | AzureCloud | 443 | The nodes of your Azure-SSIS IR in the virtual network use this port to access Azure services, such as Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs. |
| Outbound | TCP | VirtualNetwork | * | Internet | 80 | (Optional) The nodes of your Azure-SSIS IR in the virtual network use this port to download a certificate revocation list from the internet. If you block this traffic, you might experience performance downgrade when start IR and lose capability to check certificate revocation list for certificate usage. If you want to further narrow down destination to certain FQDNs, please refer to **Use Azure ExpressRoute or UDR** section|
| Outbound | TCP | VirtualNetwork | * | Sql | 1433, 11000-11999 | (Optional) This rule is only required when the nodes of your Azure-SSIS IR in the virtual network access an SSISDB hosted by your server. If your server connection policy is set to **Proxy** instead of **Redirect**, only port 1433 is needed. <br/><br/> This outbound security rule isn't applicable to an SSISDB hosted by your SQL Managed Instance in the virtual network or SQL Database configured with private endpoint. |
| Outbound | TCP | VirtualNetwork | * | VirtualNetwork | 1433, 11000-11999 | (Optional) This rule is only required when the nodes of your Azure-SSIS IR in the virtual network access an SSISDB hosted by your SQL Managed Instance in the virtual network or SQL Database configured with private endpoint. If your server connection policy is set to **Proxy** instead of **Redirect**, only port 1433 is needed. |
| Outbound | TCP | VirtualNetwork | * | Storage | 445 | (Optional) This rule is only required when you want to execute SSIS package stored in Azure Files. |
||||||||

## <a name="route"></a> Use Azure ExpressRoute or UDR
If you want to inspect outbound traffic from Azure-SSIS IR, you can route traffic initiated from Azure-SSIS IR to on-premises firewall appliance via [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) force tunneling (advertising a BGP route, 0.0.0.0/0, to the virtual network) or to Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) as a firewall or [Azure Firewall](../firewall/index.yml) via [UDRs](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md). 

:::image type="content" source="media/join-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-virtual-network/azure-ssis-ir-nva.png" alt-text="NVA scenario for Azure-SSIS IR":::

You need to do below things to make whole scenario working
   -   Inbound traffic between Azure Batch management services and the Azure-SSIS IR can't be routed via firewall appliance.
   -   The firewall appliance shall allow outbound traffic required by Azure-SSIS IR.

Inbound traffic between Azure Batch management services and the Azure-SSIS IR can't be routed to firewall appliance otherwise the traffic will be broken due to asymmetric routing problem. Routes must be defined for inbound traffic so the traffic can reply back the same way it came in. You can define specific UDRs to route traffic between Azure Batch management services and the Azure-SSIS IR with next hop type as **Internet**.

For example, if your Azure-SSIS IR is located at `UK South` and you want to inspect outbound traffic through Azure Firewall, you would firstly get an IP range list of service tag `BatchNodeManagement.UKSouth` from the [service tags IP range download link](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519) or through the [Service Tag Discovery API](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#service-tags-on-premises). Then apply the following UDRs of related IP range routes with the next hop type as **Internet** along with the 0.0.0.0/0 route with the next hop type as **Virtual appliance**.

:::image type="content" source="media/join-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-virtual-network/azurebatch-udr-settings.png" alt-text="Azure Batch UDR settings":::

> [!NOTE]
> This approach incurs an additional maintenance cost. Regularly check the IP range and add new IP ranges into your UDR to avoid breaking the Azure-SSIS IR. We recommend checking the IP range monthly because when the new IP appears in the service tag, the IP will take another month go into effect. 

To make the setup of UDR rules easier, you can run following PowerShell script to add UDR rules for Azure Batch management services:
```powershell
$Location = "[location of your Azure-SSIS IR]"
$RouteTableResourceGroupName = "[name of Azure resource group that contains your Route Table]"
$RouteTableResourceName = "[resource name of your Azure Route Table ]"
$RouteTable = Get-AzRouteTable -ResourceGroupName $RouteTableResourceGroupName -Name $RouteTableResourceName
$ServiceTags = Get-AzNetworkServiceTag -Location $Location
$BatchServiceTagName = "BatchNodeManagement." + $Location
$UdrRulePrefixForBatch = $BatchServiceTagName
if ($ServiceTags -ne $null)
{
    $BatchIPRanges = $ServiceTags.Values | Where-Object { $_.Name -ieq $BatchServiceTagName }
    if ($BatchIPRanges -ne $null)
    {
        Write-Host "Start to add rule for your route table..."
        for ($i = 0; $i -lt $BatchIPRanges.Properties.AddressPrefixes.Count; $i++)
        {
            $UdrRuleName = "$($UdrRulePrefixForBatch)_$($i)"
            Add-AzRouteConfig -Name $UdrRuleName `
                -AddressPrefix $BatchIPRanges.Properties.AddressPrefixes[$i] `
                -NextHopType "Internet" `
                -RouteTable $RouteTable `
                | Out-Null
            Write-Host "Add rule $UdrRuleName to your route table..."
        }
        Set-AzRouteTable -RouteTable $RouteTable
    }
}
else
{
    Write-Host "Failed to fetch service tags, please confirm that your Location is valid."
}
```

For firewall appliance to allow outbound traffic, you need to allow outbound to below ports same as requirement in NSG outbound rules.
-   Port 443 with destination as Azure Cloud services.

    If you use Azure Firewall, you can specify network rule with AzureCloud Service Tag. For firewall of the other types, you can either simply allow destination as all for port 443 or allow below FQDNs based on the type of your Azure environment:

    | Azure environment | Endpoints                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

    As for the FQDNs of Azure Storage, Azure Container Registry and Event Hub, you can also choose to enable the following service endpoints for your virtual network so that network traffic to these endpoints goes through Azure backbone network instead of being routed to your firewall appliance:
    -  Microsoft.Storage
    -  Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
    -  Microsoft.EventHub


-   Port 80 with destination as CRL download sites.

    You shall allow below FQDNs which are used as CRL (Certificate Revocation List) download sites of certificates for Azure-SSIS IR management purpose:
    -  crl.microsoft.com:80
    -  mscrl.microsoft.com:80
    -  crl3.digicert.com:80
    -  crl4.digicert.com:80
    -  ocsp.digicert.com:80
    -  cacerts.digicert.com:80
    
    If you are using certificates having different CRL, you are suggested to include them as well. You can read this to understand more on [Certificate Revocation List](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2303.understanding-access-to-microsoft-certificate-revocation-list.aspx).

    If you disallow this traffic, you might experience performance downgrade when start Azure-SSIS IR and lose capability to check certificate revocation list for certificate usage which is not recommended from security point of view.

-   Port 1433, 11000-11999 with destination as Azure SQL Database (only required when the nodes of your Azure-SSIS IR in the virtual network access an SSISDB hosted by your server).

    If you use Azure Firewall, you can specify network rule with Azure SQL Service Tag, otherwise you might allow destination as a specific Azure SQL URL in firewall appliance.

-   Port 445 with destination as Azure Storage (only required when you execute SSIS package stored in Azure Files).

    If you use Azure Firewall, you can specify network rule with Storage Service Tag, otherwise you might allow destination as specific Azure file share URL in firewall appliance.

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure SQL and Storage, if you configure Virtual Network service endpoints on your subnet, then traffic between Azure-SSIS IR and Azure SQL in same region \ Azure Storage in same region or paired region will be routed to Microsoft Azure backbone network directly instead of your firewall appliance.

If you don't need capability of inspecting outbound traffic of Azure-SSIS IR, you can simply apply route to force all traffic to next hop type **Internet**:

-   In an Azure ExpressRoute scenario, you can apply a 0.0.0.0/0 route with the next hop type as **Internet** on the subnet that hosts the Azure-SSIS IR. 
-   In a NVA scenario, you can modify the existing 0.0.0.0/0 route applied on the subnet that hosts the Azure-SSIS IR from the next hop type as **Virtual appliance** to **Internet**.

:::image type="content" source="media/join-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-virtual-network/add-route-for-vnet.png" alt-text="Add a route":::

> [!NOTE]
> Specify route with next hop type **Internet** doesn't mean all traffic will go over Internet. As long as destination address is for one of Azure's services, Azure routes the traffic directly to the service over Azure's backbone network, rather than routing the traffic to the Internet.

## <a name="resource-group"></a> Set up the resource group

The Azure-SSIS IR needs to create certain network resources under the same resource group as the virtual network. These resources include:
- An Azure load balancer, with the name *\<Guid>-azurebatch-cloudserviceloadbalancer*.
- An Azure public IP address, with the name *\<Guid>-azurebatch-cloudservicepublicip*.
- A network work security group, with the name *\<Guid>-azurebatch-cloudservicenetworksecuritygroup*. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can now bring your own static public IP addresses for Azure-SSIS IR. In this scenario, we will create only the Azure load balancer and network security group under the same resource group as your static public IP addresses instead of the virtual network.

Those resources will be created when your Azure-SSIS IR starts. They'll be deleted when your Azure-SSIS IR stops. If you bring your own static public IP addresses for Azure-SSIS IR, your own static public IP addresses won't be deleted when your Azure-SSIS IR stops. To avoid blocking your Azure-SSIS IR from stopping, don't reuse these network resources in your other resources.

Make sure that you have no resource lock on the resource group/subscription to which the virtual network/your static public IP addresses belong. If you configure a read-only/delete lock, starting and stopping your Azure-SSIS IR will fail, or it will stop responding.

Make sure that you don't have an Azure Policy assignment that prevents the following resources from being created under the resource group/subscription to which the virtual network/your static public IP addresses belong: 
- Microsoft.Network/LoadBalancers 
- Microsoft.Network/NetworkSecurityGroups 
- Microsoft.Network/PublicIPAddresses 

Make sure that the resource quota of your subscription is enough for the above three network resources. Specifically, for each Azure-SSIS IR created in virtual network, you need to reserve two free quotas for each of the above three network resources. The extra one quota will be used when we periodically upgrade your Azure-SSIS IR.

## <a name="faq"></a> FAQ

- How can I protect the public IP address exposed on my Azure-SSIS IR for inbound connection? Is it possible to remove the public IP address?
 
  Right now, a public IP address will be automatically created when your Azure-SSIS IR joins a virtual network. We do have an NIC-level NSG to allow only Azure Batch management services to inbound-connect to your Azure-SSIS IR. You can also specify a subnet-level NSG for inbound protection.

  If you don't want any public IP address to be exposed, consider [configuring a self-hosted IR as proxy for your Azure-SSIS IR](./self-hosted-integration-runtime-proxy-ssis.md) instead of joining your Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network, if this applies to your scenario.
 
- Can I add the public IP address of my Azure-SSIS IR to the firewall's allowlist for my data sources?

  You can now bring your own static public IP addresses for Azure-SSIS IR. In this case, you can add your IP addresses to the firewall's allowlist for your data sources. You can also consider other options below to secure data access from your Azure-SSIS IR depending on your scenario:

  - If your data source is on premises, after connecting a virtual network to your on-premises network and joining your Azure-SSIS IR to the virtual network subnet, you can then add the private IP address range of that subnet to the firewall's allowlist for your data source.
  - If your data source is an Azure service that supports virtual network service endpoints, you can configure a virtual network service endpoint on your virtual network subnet and join your Azure-SSIS IR to that subnet. You can then add a virtual network rule with that subnet to the firewall for your data source.
  - If your data source is a non-Azure cloud service, you can use a UDR to route outbound traffic from your Azure-SSIS IR to an NVA/Azure Firewall via a static public IP address. You can then add the static public IP address of your NVA/Azure Firewall to the firewall's allowlist for your data source.
  - If none of the above options meets your needs, consider [configuring a self-hosted IR as proxy for your Azure-SSIS IR](./self-hosted-integration-runtime-proxy-ssis.md). You can then add the static public IP address of the machine that hosts your self-hosted IR to the firewall's allowlist for your data source.

- Why do I need to provide two static public addresses if I want to bring my own for Azure-SSIS IR?

  Azure-SSIS IR is automatically updated on a regular basis. New nodes are created during upgrade and old ones will be deleted. However, to avoid downtime, the old nodes will not be deleted until the new ones are ready. Thus, your first static public IP address used by the old nodes cannot be released immediately and we need your second static public IP address to create the new nodes.

- I have brought my own static public IP addresses for Azure-SSIS IR, but why it still cannot access my data sources?

  - Confirm that the two static public IP addresses are both added to the firewall's allowlist for your data sources. Each time your Azure-SSIS IR is upgraded, its static public IP address is switched between the two brought by you. If you add only one of them to the allowlist, data access for your Azure-SSIS IR will be broken after its upgrade.
  - If your data source is an Azure service, please check whether you have configured it with virtual network service endpoints. If that's the case, the traffic from Azure-SSIS IR to your data source will switch to use the private IP addresses managed by Azure services and adding your own static public IP addresses to the firewall's allowlist for your data source will not take effect.
