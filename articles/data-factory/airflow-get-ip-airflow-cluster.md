# Retrieve the IP address of a Managed Airflow cluster

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

To restrict access to your data stores or resources solely to your Managed Airflow cluster and prevent access from all other IP addresses via the public endpoint, you can retrieve the dedicated IP address specific to your Managed Airflow environment and add it to your storage firewall's allow list. This enables you to access data stores or resources secured by the firewall through the list of permitted IP addresses on the allow list of the firewall.

This article shows you how to retrieve the Managed Airflow clusterâ€™s IP address and add it to the storage account you want to secure.

> [!NOTE]
> Importing DAGs is currently not supported using blob storage with IP allow listing or using private endpoints. We suggest using Git-sync instead.

## Step 1: Retrieve the Managed Airflow cluster IP address

Refer to the REST API documentation for [Integration Runtimes - Get](/rest/api/datafactory/integration-runtimes/get?tabs=HTTP#code-try-0).

## Step 2: Add the Managed Airflow cluster IP address to the storage account you want to secure

> [!NOTE]
> You can add the Managed Airflow IP address to other storage services as well like Azure SQL DB, Azure Key Vault, etc.

- To add managed Airflow Cluster IP address into Azure Key Vault, refer to [Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse IP firewall rules](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security) 
- To add managed Airflow Cluster IP address into Azure Blob Storage, refer to [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security?tabs=azure-portal#grant-access-from-an-internet-ip-range)
- To add managed Airflow Cluster IP address into Azure SQL Database, refer to [Configure Azure Key Vault firewalls and virtual networks](/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure)
- To add managed Airflow Cluster IP address into Azure PostgreSQL Database, refer to [Create and manage firewall rules for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server using the Azure portal](/azure/postgresql/single-server/how-to-manage-firewall-using-portal)
