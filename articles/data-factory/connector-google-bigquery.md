# Copy data from Google BigQuery using Azure Data Factory (Beta)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Google BigQuery. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [Copy Activity in V1](v1/data-factory-data-movement-activities.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in Beta. You can try it out and give us feedback. Do not use it in production environments.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Google BigQuery to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started-2](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started-2.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Google BigQuery connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Google BigQuery linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **GoogleBigQuery** | Yes |
| project | The project ID of the default BigQuery project to query against.  | Yes |
| additionalProjects | A comma-separated list of project IDs of public BigQuery projects to access.  | No |
| requestGoogleDriveScope | Whether to request access to Google Drive. Allowing Google Drive access enables support for federated tables that combine BigQuery data with data from Google Drive. The default value is false.  | No |
| authenticationType | The OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism used for authentication. ServiceAuthentication can only be used on self-hosted IR. <br/>Allowed values are: **ServiceAuthentication**, **UserAuthentication** | Yes |
| refreshToken | The refresh token obtained from Google for authorizing access to BigQuery for UserAuthentication. You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in ADF, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let the copy activity pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| email | The service account email ID that is used for ServiceAuthentication and can only be used on self-hosted IR.  | No |
| keyFilePath | The full path to the .p12 key file that is used to authenticate the service account email address and can only be used on self-hosted IR.  | No |
| trustedCertPath | The full path of the .pem file containing trusted CA certificates for verifying the server when connecting over SSL. This property can only be set when using SSL on self-hosted IR. The default value is the cacerts.pem file installed with the IR.  | No |
| useSystemTrustStore | Specifies whether to use a CA certificate from the system trust store or from a specified PEM file. The default value is false.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "GoogleBigQueryLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "GoogleBigQuery",
        "typeProperties": {
            "project" : "<project ID>",
            "additionalProjects" : "<additional project IDs>",
            "requestGoogleDriveScope" : true,
            "authenticationType" : "UserAuthentication",
            "refreshToken": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<refresh token>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Google BigQuery dataset.

To copy data from Google BigQuery, set the type property of the dataset to **GoogleBigQueryObject**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "GoogleBigQueryDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "GoogleBigQueryObject",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<GoogleBigQuery linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Google BigQuery source.

### GoogleBigQuerySource as source

To copy data from Google BigQuery, set the source type in the copy activity to **GoogleBigQuerySource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **GoogleBigQuerySource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromGoogleBigQuery",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<GoogleBigQuery input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "GoogleBigQuerySource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
