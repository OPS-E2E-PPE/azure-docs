# Quickstart: Create and configure a dev center

This quickstart shows you how to create and configure a dev center in Azure Deployment Environments Preview.

An enterprise development infrastructure team typically sets up a dev center, attaches external catalogs to the dev center, creates projects, and provides access to development teams. Development teams create [environments](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environments) by using [catalog items](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#catalog-items), connect to individual resources, and deploy applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Deployment Environments currently is in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, review the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Create a Key Vault
You'll need an Azure Key Vault to store the GitHub personal access token (PAT) that is used to grant Azure access to your GitHub repository. 
If you don't have an existing key vault, use the following steps to create one:

1.	Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1.	In the Search box, enter *Key Vault*.
1.	From the results list, select **Key Vault**.
1.	On the Key Vault page, select **Create**.
1.	On the Create key vault page provide the following information:

    |Name      |Value      |
    |----------|-----------|
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the key vault.|
    |**Subscription**|Select the subscription in which you want to create the key vault.|
    |**Resource group**|Either use an existing resource group or select **Create new** and enter a name for the resource group.|
    |**Location**|Select the location or region where you want to create the key vault.|
    
    Leave the other options at their defaults.

1.	Select **Create**.

## Create a personal access token
Using an authentication token like a GitHub personal access token (PAT) enables you to share your repository securely.  

> [!TIP] 
> If you are attaching an Azure DevOps repository, use these steps: [Create a personal access token in Azure DevOps](how-to-configure-catalog.md#create-a-personal-access-token-in-azure-devops).

1.	In a new browser tab, sign into your [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
1.	On your profile menu, select **Settings**.
1.	On your account page, on the left menu, select **< >Developer Settings**.
1.	On the Developer settings page, select **Tokens (classic)**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/github-pat.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the GitHub Tokens (classic) option.":::
    
    Fine grained and classic tokens work with Azure Deployment Environments.

1. On the New personal access token (classic) page:
    - In the **Note** box, add a note describing the token’s intended use.
    - In **Select scopes**, select repo.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/generate-git-hub-token.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the GitHub Tokens (classic) configuration page.":::

1. Select **Generate token**.
1. On the Personal access tokens (classic) page, copy the new token.

    > [!WARNING]
    > You must copy the token now. You will not be able to access it again.

1.	Switch back to the **Key Vault – Microsoft Azure** browser tab.
1.	In the Key Vault, on the left menu, select **Secrets**.
1.	On the Secrets page, select **Generate/Import**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/import-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the key vault Secrets page with the generate/import button highlighted.":::

1.	On the Create a secret page:
    - In the **Name** box, enter a descriptive name for your secret.
    - In the **Secret value** box, paste the GitHub secret you copied in step 7.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/create-secret-in-key-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create a secret page with the Name and Secret value text boxes highlighted.":::

    - Select **Create**.
1.	Leave this tab open, you’ll need to come back to the Key Vault later.

## Attach an identity to the dev center

After you create a dev center, attach an [identity](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#identities) to the dev center. You can attach either a system-assigned managed identity or a user-assigned managed identity. Learn about the two [types of identities](how-to-configure-managed-identity.md#add-a-managed-identity).

In this quickstart, you'll configure a system-assigned managed identity for your dev center. 

## Attach a system-assigned managed identity

To attach a system-assigned managed identity to your dev center:

1.	In Dev centers, select your dev center.
1.	In the left menu under Settings, select **Identity**.
1.	Under **System assigned**, set **Status** to **On**, and then select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/system-assigned-managed-identity-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a system-assigned managed identity.":::

1.	In the **Enable system assigned managed identity** dialog, select **Yes**.

### Assign the system-assigned managed identity access to the key vault secret
Make sure that the identity has access to the key vault secret that contains the personal access token to access your repository.

Configure a key vault access policy:
1.	In the Azure portal, go to the key vault that contains the secret with the personal access token.
2.	In the left menu, select **Access policies**, and then select **Create**.
3.	In Create an access policy, enter or select the following information:
    - On the Permissions tab, under **Secret permissions**, select **Select all**, and then select **Next**.
    - On the Principal tab, select the identity that's attached to the dev center, and then select **Next**.
    - Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.


## Add a catalog to the dev center
Azure Deployment Environments Preview supports attaching Azure DevOps repositories and GitHub repositories. You can store a set of curated IaC templates in a repository. Attaching the repository to a dev center as a catalog gives your development teams access to the templates and enables them to quickly create consistent environments.

In this quickstart, you'll attach a GitHub repository that contains samples created and maintained by the Azure Deployment Environments team.

To add a catalog to your dev center, you'll first need to gather some information.

### Gather GitHub repo information
To add a catalog, you must specify the GitHub repo URL, the branch, and the folder that contains your catalog items. You can gather this information before you begin the process of adding the catalog to the dev center, and paste it somewhere accessible, like notepad.

> [!TIP] 
>  If you are attaching an Azure DevOps repository, use these steps: [Get the clone URL of an Azure DevOps repository](how-to-configure-catalog.md#get-the-clone-url-of-an-azure-devops-repository).

1. On your [GitHub](https://github.com) account page, select **<> Code**, and then select copy.
1. Take a note of the branch that you're working in.
1. Take a note of the folder that contains your catalog items. 
 
     :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/github-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the GitHub repo with Code, branch, and folder highlighted.":::

### Gather the secret identifier
You'll also need the path to the secret you created in the key vault. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your key vault.
1. On the key vault page, from the left menu, select **Secrets**.
1. On the Secrets page, select the secret you created earlier.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/key-vault-secrets-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of secrets in the key vault with one highlighted.":::

1. On the versions page, select the **CURRENT VERSION**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/key-vault-versions-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the current version of the select secret.":::

1. On the current version page, for the **Secret identifier**, select copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/key-vault-current-version-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details current version of the select secret with the secret identifier copy button highlighted.":::

### Add a catalog to your dev center
1. Navigate to your dev center.
1. In the left menu under **Environment configuration**, select **Catalogs**, and then select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/catalogs-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Catalogs pane.":::

1. In the **Add catalog** pane, enter the following information, and then select **Add**.

    | Name | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | **Name** | Enter a name for the catalog. |
    | **Git clone URI**  | Enter or paste the clone URL for either your GitHub repository or your Azure DevOps repository.<br/>*Sample Catalog Example:* https://github.com/Azure/deployment-environments.git |
    | **Branch**  | Enter the repository branch to connect to.<br/>*Sample Catalog Example:* main|
    | **Folder path**  | Enter the folder path relative to the clone URI that contains subfolders with your catalog items. </br>This folder path should be the path to the folder that contains the subfolders with the catalog item manifests, and not the path to the folder with the catalog item manifest itself.<br/>*Sample Catalog Example:* /Environments|
    | **Secret identifier**| Enter the secret identifier that contains your personal access token for the repository.|

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-catalog/add-catalog-form-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add a catalog to a dev center." lightbox="media/how-to-configure-catalog/add-catalog-form-expanded.png":::

1. Confirm that the catalog is successfully added by checking your Azure portal notifications.

## Create an environment type

Use an environment type to help you define the different types of environments your development teams can deploy. You can apply different settings for each environment type.

1. In the Azure portal, go to Azure Deployment Environments.
1. In **Dev centers**, select your dev center.
1. In the left menu under **Environment configuration**, select **Environment types**, and then select **Create**.
1. In **Create environment type**, enter the following information, and then select **Add**.

    |Name     |Value     |
    |---------|----------|
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the environment type.|
    |**Tags**|Enter a tag name and a tag value.|

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter/create-environment-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create environment type pane.":::

1. Confirm that the environment type is added by checking your Azure portal notifications.

An environment type that you add to your dev center is available in each project in the dev center, but environment types aren't enabled by default. When you enable an environment type at the project level, the environment type determines the managed identity and subscription that are used to deploy environments.

## Next steps
