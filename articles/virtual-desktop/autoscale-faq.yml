    questions:
      - question: |
         How do I configure autoscale so I run zero session hosts after working hours?
        answer: |
         Ramp-down mode always uses the lowest possible number of session hosts possible. However, if active sessions exist, the lowest number of usable session hosts won't be zero. Configure a time limit policy to sign out all disconnected users to avoid having usable session hosts after hours.
          
      - question: |
         Does autoscale create or delete virtual machines (VMs) based on service load?
        answer: |
         No.

      - question: |
         Can I configure scaling for specific dates like holidays?
        answer: |
         No. Autoscale doesnâ€™t currently support ramping down on specific dates.
