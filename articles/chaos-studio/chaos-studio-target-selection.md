# Target selection in Azure Chaos Studio

Every chaos experiment is made up of a different combination of faults and targets, building up to a unique outage scenario to test your system's resilience against. You may want to select a fixed set of targets for your chaos experiment, or provide a rule in which all matching fault-onboarded resources are included as targets in your experiment. Chaos Studio enables you to do both by providing both manual and query-based target selection.

## List-based manual target selection

List-based manual target selection allows you to select a fixed set of onboarded targets for a particular fault in your chaos experiment. Depending on the selected fault, you may select one or more onboarded resources to target. The aforementioned resources are added to the experiment upon creation time. In order to modify the list, you must navigate to the experiment's page and add or remove fault targets manually. An example of manual target selection is shown below.

## Query-based dynamic target selection

Query-based dynamic target selection allows you to input a KQL query that will select all onboarded targets that match the query result set. Using your query, you may filter targets based on common Azure resource parameters including type, region, name, and more. Upon experiment creation time, only the query itself will be added to your chaos experiment. 

The inputted query will run and add onboarded targets that match its result set upon experiment execution time. Thus, any resources onboarded to Chaos Studio after experiment creation time that match the query result set upon experiment execution time will be targeted by your experiment. You may your query's result set when adding it to your experiment, but be aware that it may not match the result set at experiment execution time. An example of a possible dynamic target query is shown below.
