# Troubleshooting the SAP Deployment Automation Framework


Within the SAP Deployment Automation Framework (SDAF), we recognize that there are many moving parts.  This article is intended to help you troubleshoot issues that you can encounter.

## Deployment

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues that you can encounter when performing deployments using the SAP Deployment Automation Framework.

### Unable to access keyvault: XXXXX error

If you see an error similar to the following when running the deployment:

```text
Unable to access keyvault: XXXXYYYYDEP00userBEB                             
Please ensure the key vault exists.
```

This error indicates that the specified key vault doesn't exist or that the deployment environment is unable to access it. 

Depending on the deployment stage, you can resolve this issue in the following ways:

You can either add the IP of the environment from which you're executing the deployment (recommended) or you can allow public access to the key vault. See [Allow public access to a key vault](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security#allow-public-access-to-a-key-vault) for more information.

The following variables are used to configure the key vault access:

```tfvars
Agent_IP                      = "10.0.0.5"
public_network_access_enabled = true
```

### OverconstrainedAllocationRequest error
If you see an error similar to the following when running the deployment:

```text
Virtual Machine Name: "devsap01app01": Code="OverconstrainedAllocationRequest" Message="Allocation failed. VM(s) with the following constraints cannot be allocated, because the condition is too restrictive. Please remove some constraints and try again. Constraints applied are:
- Networking Constraints (such as Accelerated Networking or IPv6)
- VM Size
```

This error indicates that the selected VM size isn't available using the provided constraints.  To resolve this issue, select a different VM size or a different availability zone.

### The client 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' with object id error
If you see an error similar to the following message when running the deployment:

```text

The client 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' with object id 'yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy' does not have
authorization or an ABAC condition not fulfilled to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' over scope '/subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/DEV-WEEU-SAP01-X00/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/....
```

The error indicates that the deployment credential doesn't have 'User Access Administrator' role on the resource group. To resolve this issue, assign the 'User Access Administrator' role to the deployment credential on the resource group or the subscription (if feasible).

## Configuration

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues that you can encounter when performing configuration using the SAP Deployment Automation Framework.

### Task 'ansible.builtin.XXX' has extra params'

If you see an error similar to the following message when running the deployment:

```text
ERROR! this task 'ansible.builtin.command' has extra params, which is only allowed in the following modules: set_fact, shell, include_tasks, win_shell, import_tasks, import_role, include, win_command, command, include_role, meta, add_host, script, group_by, raw, include_vars
```

This error indicates that the task isn't supported by the version of Ansible that is installed. To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest version of Ansible on the agent virtual machine.

## Software download

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues that you can encounter when downloading the SAP software using the SAP Deployment Automation Framework.

### "HTTP Error 404: Not Found"

This error indicates that the software version is no longer available for download. Open a GitHub issue [New Issue](https://github.com/Azure/SAP-automation-samples/issues/new/choose)to request an update to the Bill of Materials file, or update the Bill of Materials file yourself and submit a pull request.

## Azure DevOps

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues that you can encounter when using Azure DevOps with the SAP Deployment Automation Framework.

### Issues with the Azure Pipelines

If you see an error similar to the following message when running the Azure Pipelines:

```text
##[error]Variable group SDAF-MGMT could not be found.
##[error]Bash exited with code '2'.
```

This error indicates that the configured personal access token doesn't have permissions to access the variable group. Ensure that the personal access token has the **Read & manage** permission for the variable group and that it hasn't expired. The personal access token is configured in the Azure DevOps pipeline variable groups either as 'PAT' in the control plane variable group or as WZ_PAT in the workload zone variable group.
