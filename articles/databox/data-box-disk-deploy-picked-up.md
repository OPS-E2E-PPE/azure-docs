## Ship Data Box Disk back

::: zone-end

1. Once the data validation is complete, unplug the disks. Remove the connecting cables.
2. Wrap all the disks and the connecting cables with a bubble wrap and place those into the shipping box. Charges may apply if the accessories are missing.
    - Reuse the packaging from the initial shipment.  
    - We recommend that you pack disks using a well-secured bubbled wrap.
    - Make sure the fit is snug to reduce any movements within the box.

The next steps are determined by where you are returning the device.
