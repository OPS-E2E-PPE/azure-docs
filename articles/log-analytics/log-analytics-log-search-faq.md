# Log Analytics new log search FAQ and known issues

This article includes frequently asked questions and known issues regarding the upgrade of [Log Analytics to the new query language](log-analytics-log-search-upgrade.md).  You should read through this entire article before making the decision to upgrade your workspace.


## Alerts

### Question: I have a lot of alert rules. Do I need to create them again in the new language after I upgrade?  
No, your alert rules are automatically converted to the new search language during upgrade.  


## Computer groups

### Question: I'm getting errors when trying to use computer groups.  Has their syntax changed?
Yes, the syntax for using computer groups changes when your workspace is upgraded.  See [Computer groups in Log Analytics log searches](log-analytics-computer-groups.md) for details.

### Known issue: Groups imported from Active Directory
You cannot currently create a query that uses a computer group imported from Active Directory.  As a workaround until this issue is corrected, create a new computer group using the imported Active Directory group and then use that new group in your query.

An example query to create a new computer group that includes an imported Active Directory group is as follows:

	ComputerGroup | where GroupSource == "ActiveDirectory" and Group == "AD Group Name" and TimeGenerated >= ago(24h) | distinct Computer


## Dashboards

### Question: Can I still use dashboards in an upgraded workspace?
You can continue to use any tiles that you added to **My Dashboard** before your workspace was upgraded, but you cannot edit those tiles or add new ones.  You can continue to create and edit views with [View Designer](log-analytics-view-designer.md) and also create dashboards in the Azure portal.


## Log searches

### Question: I have saved searches outside of my upgraded workspace. Can I convert them to the new search language automatically?
You can use the language converter tool in the log search page to convert each one.  There is no method to automatically convert multiple searches without upgrading the workspace.

### Question: Why are my query results not sorted?
Results are not sorted by default in the new query language.  Use the [sort operator](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=856079) to sort your results by one or more properties.

### Known issue: Search results in a list may include properties with no data
Log search results in a list may display properties with no data.  Prior to upgrade, these properties wouldn't be included.  This issue will be corrected so that empty properties are not displayed.

### Known issue: Selecting a value in a chart doesn't display detailed results
Prior to upgrade, when you selected a value in a chart, it would return a detailed list of records matching the selected value.  After upgrade, only the single summarized line is returned.  This issue is currently being investigated.

## Log Search API

### Question: Does the Log Search API get updated after I upgrade?
The [Log Search API](log-analytics-log-search-api.md) has not yet been upgraded to the new search language.  Continue to use the legacy query language with this API, even after you upgrade your workspace.  Updated documentation will become available for the Log Search API when it's updated.


## Portals

### Question: Should I use the new Advanced Analytics portal or keep using the Log Search portal?
You can see a comparison of the two portals at [Portals for creating and editing log queries in Azure Log Analytics](log-analytics-log-search-portals.md).  Each has distinct advantages so you can choose the best one for your requirements.  It's common to write queries in the Advanced Analytics portal and paste them into other places such as View Designer.  You should read about [issues to consider](log-analytics-log-search-portals.md#advanced-analytics-portal) when doing that.


## Power BI

### Question: Does anything change with PowerBI integration?
Yes.  Once your workspace has been upgraded then the process for exporting Log Analytics data to Power BI will no longer work.  Any existing schedules that you created before upgrading will become disabled.  After upgrade, Azure Log Analytics uses the same platform as Application Insights, and you use the same process to export Log Analytics queries to Power BI as [the process to export Application Insights queries to Power BI](../application-insights/app-insights-export-power-bi.md#export-analytics-queries).

### Known issue: Power BI request size limit
There is currently a size limit of 8 MB for a Log Analytics query that can be exported to Power BI.  This limit will be increased soon.


##PowerShell cmdlets

### Question: Does the Log Search PowerShell cmdlet get updated after I upgrade?
The [Get-AzureRmOperationalInsightsSearchResults](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.operationalinsights/Get-AzureRmOperationalInsightsSearchResults) has not yet been upgraded to the new search language.  Continue to use the legacy query language with this cmdlet, even after you upgrade your workspace.  Updated documentation will become available for the cmdlet when it's updated.


## Resource Manager templates

### Question: Can I create an upgraded workspace with a Resource Manager template?
Yes.  You must use an API version of 2017-03-15-preview and include a **features** section in your template as in the following example.

    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces",
            "apiVersion": "2017-03-15-preview",
            "name": "[parameters('workspaceName')]",
            "location": "[parameters('workspaceRegion')]",
            "properties": {
                "sku": {
                    "name": "Free"
                },
                "features": {
                    "legacy": 0,
                    "searchVersion": 1
                }
            }
        }
    ],



## Solutions

### Question: Will my solutions continue to work?
All solutions will continue to work in an upgraded workspace, although their performance will improve if they are converted to the new query language.  There are known issues with some existing solutions that are described in this section.

### Known issue: Capacity and Performance solution
Some of the parts in the [Capacity and Performance](log-analytics-capacity.md) view may be empty.  A fix to this issue will be available shortly.

### Known issue: Device Health solution
The [Device Health solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/device-health-monitor) will not collect data in an upgraded workspace.  A fix to this issue will be available shortly.

### Known issue: Application Insights connector
Perspectives in [Application Insights Connector solution](log-analytics-app-insights-connector.md) are currently not supported in an upgraded workspace.  A fix to this issue is currently under analysis.

## Upgrade process

### Question: I have several workspaces. Can I upgrade all workspaces at the same time?  
No.  Upgrade applies to a single workspace each time. Currently there is no way of upgrading many workspaces at once. Please note that other users of the upgraded workspace will be affected as well.  

### Question: Will existing log data collected in my workspace be modified if I upgrade?  
No. The log data available to your workspace searches is not affected by the upgrade. Saved searches, alerts and views will be converted to the new search language automatically.  

### Question: What happens if I don't upgrade my workspace?  
The legacy log search will be deprecated in the coming months. Workspaces that are not upgraded by that time will be upgraded automatically.

### Question: I didn't choose to upgrade, but my workspace has been upgraded anyway! What happened?  
Another admin of this workspace could have upgraded the workspace. Please note that all workspaces will be automatically upgraded when the new language reaches general availability.  

### Question: I have upgraded by mistake and now need to cancel it and restore everything back. What should I do?!  
No problem.  We create a snapshot of your workspace before upgrade, so you can restore it. Keep in mind that searches, alerts or views you saved after the upgrade will be lost though.  To restore your workspace environment, follow the procedure at [Can I go back after I upgrade?](log-analytics-log-search-upgrade.md#can-i-go-back-after-i-upgrade)


## Views

### Question: How do I create a new view with View Designer?
Prior to upgrade, you could create a new view with View Designer from a tile on the main dashboard.  When your workspace is upgraded, this tile is removed.  You can create a new view with View Designer in the OMS portal by clicking on the green + button in the left menu.

### Known issue: See all option for line charts in views doesn't result in a line chart
When you click on the *See all* option at the bottom of a line chart part in a view, you are presented with a table.  Prior to upgrade, you would be presented with a line chart.  This issue is being analyzed for a potential modification.
