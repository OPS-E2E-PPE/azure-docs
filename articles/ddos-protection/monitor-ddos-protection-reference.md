# Monitoring Azure DDoS Protection


See [Tutorial: View and configure Azure DDoS protection telemetry](telemetry.md) for details on collecting, analyzing, and monitoring DDoS Protection.

## Metrics



### DDoS protection metrics

The metric names present different packet types, and bytes vs. packets, with a basic construct of tag names on each metric as follows:

* **Dropped tag name** (for example, **Inbound Packets Dropped DDoS**): The number of packets dropped/scrubbed by the DDoS protection system.

* **Forwarded tag name** (for example **Inbound Packets Forwarded DDoS**): The number of packets forwarded by the DDoS system to the destination VIP – traffic that wasn't filtered.

* **No tag name** (for example **Inbound Packets DDoS**): The total number of packets that came into the scrubbing system – representing the sum of the packets dropped and forwarded.

> [!NOTE]
> While multiple options for **Aggregation** are displayed on Azure portal, only the aggregation types listed in the table below are supported for each metric. We apologize for this confusion and we are working to resolve it.
The following [Azure Monitor metrics](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftnetworkpublicipaddresses) are available for Azure DDoS Protection. These metrics are also exportable via diagnostic settings, see [View and configure DDoS diagnostic logging](diagnostic-logging.md).

## Diagnostic logs

See [Tutorial: View and configure Azure DDoS Protection diagnostic logging](diagnostic-logging.md) for details on attack insights and visualization with DDoS Attack Analytics.

The following diagnostic logs are available for Azure DDoS Protection:

- **DDoSProtectionNotifications**: Notifications will notify you anytime a public IP resource is under attack, and when attack mitigation is over.
- **DDoSMitigationFlowLogs**: Attack mitigation flow logs allow you to review the dropped traffic, forwarded traffic and other interesting data-points during an active DDoS attack in near-real time. You can ingest the constant stream of this data into Microsoft Sentinel or to your third-party SIEM systems via event hub for near-real time monitoring, take potential actions and address the need of your defense operations.
- **DDoSMitigationReports**: Attack mitigation reports use the Netflow protocol data, which is aggregated to provide detailed information about the attack on your resource. Anytime a public IP resource is under attack, the report generation will start as soon as the mitigation starts. There will be an incremental report generated every 5 mins and a post-mitigation report for the whole mitigation period. This is to ensure that in an event the DDoS attack continues for a longer duration of time, you'll be able to view the most current snapshot of mitigation report every 5 minutes and a complete summary once the attack mitigation is over.
- **AllMetrics**: Provides all possible metrics available during the duration of a DDoS attack.
