# View Azure DDoS Protection logs in Log Analytics workspace

In this guide, you'll learn how to view Azure DDoS Protection diagnostic logs, including notifications, mitigation reports and mitigation flow logs.
## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [DDoS Network Protection](manage-ddos-protection.md) must be enabled on a virtual network or [DDoS IP Protection](manage-ddos-protection-powershell-ip.md) must be enabled on a public IP address. 
- Configure DDoS Protection diagnostic logs. To learn more, see [Configure diagnostic logs](diagnostic-logging.md).
- Simulate an attack using one of our simulation partners. To learn more, see [Test with simulation partners](test-through-simulations.md).

### View in log analytics workspace

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Log Analytics workspace**. Select **Log Analytics workspace** in the search results.
1. Under the **Log Analytics workspaces** blade, select your workspace.
1. On the left-side tab, select **Logs**. Here you'll see the query explorer. Exit out the *Queries* pane to utilize the *Logs* page.

## Example log queries

### DDoS Protection Notifications

Notifications will notify you anytime a public IP resource is under attack, and when attack mitigation is over.

```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "DDoSProtectionNotifications"
```


The following table lists the field names and descriptions:

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TimeGenerated** | The date and time in UTC when the notification was created. |
| **ResourceId** | The resource ID of your public IP address. |
| **Category** | For notifications, this will be `DDoSProtectionNotifications`.|
| **ResourceGroup** | The resource group that contains your public IP address and virtual network. |
| **SubscriptionId** | Your DDoS protection plan subscription ID. |
| **Resource** | The name of your public IP address. |
| **ResourceType** | This will always be `PUBLICIPADDRESS`. |
| **OperationName** | For notifications, this will be `DDoSProtectionNotifications`.  |
| **Message** | Details of the attack. |
| **Type** | Type of notification. Possible values include `MitigationStarted`. `MitigationStopped`. |
| **PublicIpAddress** | Your public IP address. |

### DDoS Mitigation FlowLogs

Attack mitigation flow logs allow you to review the dropped traffic, forwarded traffic and other interesting data-points during an active DDoS attack in near-real time. You can ingest the constant stream of this data into Microsoft Sentinel or to your third-party SIEM systems via event hub for near-real time monitoring, take potential actions and address the need of your defense operations.

```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "DDoSMitigationFlowLogs"
```

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TimeGenerated** | The date and time in UTC when the flow log was created. |
| **ResourceId** | The resource ID of your public IP address. |
| **Category** | For flow logs, this will be `DDoSMitigationFlowLogs`.|
| **ResourceGroup** | The resource group that contains your public IP address and virtual network. |
| **SubscriptionId** | Your DDoS protection plan subscription ID. |
| **Resource** | The name of your public IP address. |
| **ResourceType** | This will always be `PUBLICIPADDRESS`. |
| **OperationName** | For flow logs, this will be `DDoSMitigationFlowLogs`. |
| **Message** | Details of the attack. |
| **SourcePublicIpAddress** | The public IP address of the client generating traffic to your public IP address. |
| **SourcePort** | Port number ranging from 0 to 65535. |
| **DestPublicIpAddress** | Your public IP address. |
| **DestPort** | Port number ranging from 0 to 65535. |
| **Protocol** | Type of protocol. Possible values include `tcp`, `udp`, `other`.|

### DDoS Mitigation FlowLogs

Attack mitigation reports use the Netflow protocol data, which is aggregated to provide detailed information about the attack on your resource. Anytime a public IP resource is under attack, the report generation will start as soon as the mitigation starts. There will be an incremental report generated every 5 mins and a post-mitigation report for the whole mitigation period. This is to ensure that in an event the DDoS attack continues for a longer duration of time, you'll be able to view the most current snapshot of mitigation report every 5 minutes and a complete summary once the attack mitigation is over.

```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "DDoSMitigationReports"
```

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TimeGenerated** | The date and time in UTC when the notification was created. |
| **ResourceId** | The resource ID of your public IP address. |
| **Category** | For notifications, this will be `DDoSProtectionNotifications`.|
| **ResourceGroup** | The resource group that contains your public IP address and virtual network. |
| **SubscriptionId** | Your DDoS protection plan subscription ID. |
| **Resource** | The name of your public IP address. |
| **ResourceType** | This will always be `PUBLICIPADDRESS`. |
| **OperationName** | For notifications, this will be `DDoSProtectionNotifications`.  |
| **Message** | Details of the attack. |
| **Type** | Type of notification. Possible values include `MitigationStarted`. `MitigationStopped`. |
| **PublicIpAddress** | Your public IP address. |
