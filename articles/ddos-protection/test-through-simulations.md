# Tutorial: Azure DDoS Protection simulation testing

It’s a good practice to test your assumptions about how your services respond to an attack by conducting periodic simulations. During testing, validate that your services or applications continue to function as expected and there’s no disruption to the user experience. Identify gaps from both a technology and process standpoint and incorporate them in the DDoS response strategy. We recommend that you perform such tests in staging environments or during non-peak hours to minimize the impact to the production environment.

Simulations help you:
- Validate how Azure DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
- Optimize your incident response process while under DDoS attack.
- Document DDoS compliance.
- Train your network security teams.

## Azure DDoS simulation testing policy

You may only simulate attacks using our approved testing partners:
- [BreakingPoint Cloud](https://www.ixiacom.com/products/breakingpoint-cloud): a self-service traffic generator where your customers can generate traffic against DDoS Protection-enabled public endpoints for simulations. 
- [Red Button](https://www.red-button.net/): work with a dedicated team of experts to simulate real-world DDoS attack scenarios in a controlled environment.
- [RedWolf](https://www.redwolfsecurity.com/services/#cloud-ddos) a self-service or guided DDoS testing provider with real-time control.

Our testing partners' simulation environments are built within Azure. You can only simulate against Azure-hosted public IP addresses that belong to an Azure subscription of your own, which will be validated by our partners before testing. Additionally, these target public IP addresses must be protected under Azure DDoS Protection. Simulation testing allows you to assess your current state of readiness, identify gaps in your incident response procedures, and guide you in developing a proper [DDoS response strategy](ddos-response-strategy.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> BreakingPoint Cloud and Red Button are only available for the Public cloud.

For this tutorial, you'll create a test environment that includes:
- A DDoS protection plan
- A virtual network
- An Azure Bastion host 
- A load balancer 
- Two virtual machines. 

You'll then configure diagnostic logs and alerts to monitor for attacks and traffic patterns. Finally, you'll configure a DDoS attack simulation using one of our approved testing partners.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- In order to use diagnostic logging, you must first create a [Log Analytics workspace with diagnostic settings enabled](ddos-configure-log-analytics-workspace.md).


## Prepare test environment
### Create a DDoS protection plan

1. Select **Create a resource** in the upper left corner of the Azure portal.
1. Search the term *DDoS*. When **DDoS protection plan** appears in the search results, select it.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Enter or select the following values.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/ddos-attack-simulation/create-ddos-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a DDoS protection plan.":::

    |Setting        |Value                                              |
    |---------      |---------                                          |
    |Subscription   | Select your subscription.                         |
    |Resource group | Select **Create new** and enter **MyResourceGroup**.|
    |Name           | Enter **MyDDoSProtectionPlan**.                     |
    |Region         | Enter **East US**.                                  |

1. Select **Review + create** then **Create**

### Create the virtual network

In this section, you'll create a virtual network, subnet, Azure Bastion host, and associate the DDoS Protection plan. The virtual network and subnet contains the load balancer and virtual machines. The bastion host is used to securely manage the virtual machines and install IIS to test the load balancer. The DDoS Protection plan will protect all public IP resources in the virtual network.

### Red Button

Red Button’s [DDoS Testing](https://www.red-button.net/ddos-testing/) service suite includes three stages:

1. **Planning session**: Red Button experts meet with your team to understand your network architecture, assemble technical details, and define clear goals and testing schedules. This includes planning the DDoS test scope and targets, attack vectors, and attack rates. The joint planning effort is detailed in a test plan document.
1. **Controlled DDoS attack**: Based on the defined goals, the Red Button team launches a combination of multi-vector DDoS attacks. The test typically lasts between three to six hours. Attacks are securely executed using dedicated servers and are controlled and monitored using Red Button’s management console.
1. **Summary and recommendations**: The Red Button team provides you with a written DDoS Test Report outlining the effectiveness of DDoS mitigation. The report includes an executive summary of the test results, a complete log of the simulation, a list of vulnerabilities within your infrastructure, and recommendations on how to correct them.
