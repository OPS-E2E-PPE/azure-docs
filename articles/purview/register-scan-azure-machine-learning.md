# Connect to and manage Azure Machine Learning in Microsoft Purview (Preview)

This article outlines how to register Azure Machine Learning and how to authenticate and interact with Azure Machine Learning in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

This integration between Azure Machine Learning and Microsoft Purview applies an auto push model that, once the Azure Machine Learning workspace has been registered in Microsoft Purview, the metadata from workspace is pushed to Microsoft Purview automatically on a daily basis. It isn't necessary to manually scan to bring metadata from the workspace into Microsoft Purview.
