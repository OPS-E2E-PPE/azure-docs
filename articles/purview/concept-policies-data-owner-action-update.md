# Role definitions SQL Performance Monitor and SQL Security Auditor supported only from DevOps policies experience

This guide discusses actions that have been retired from Data owner policies experience and are now supported only from the DevOps policies experience.

## Important considerations
The following two actions that were previously available in the Microsoft Purview Data owner policies experience are now supported only from the Microsoft Purview DevOps policies, which is a more focused experience.
- SQL Performance Monitor
- SQL Security Auditor

If you currently have Data owner policies with these actions we encourage you to give the DevOps policies experience a try. Creating new policies or editing existing policies that involve these two actions is now unsupported from the Data owner experience.
