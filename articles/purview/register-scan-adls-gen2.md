## Scan

### Prerequisites for scan

In order to have access to scan the data source, an authentication method in the ADLS Gen2 Storage account needs to be configured.
The following options are supported:

> [!Note]
> If you have firewall enabled for the storage account, you must use Managed Identity authentication method when setting up a scan.

* **Managed Identity (Recommended)** - As soon as the Azure Purview Account is created, a system **Managed Identity** is created automatically in Azure AD tenant. Depending on the type of resource, specific RBAC role assignments are required for the Azure Purview MSI to perform the scans.

* **Account Key** - Secrets can be created inside an Azure Key Vault to store credentials in order to enable access for Azure Purview to scan data sources securely using the secrets. A secret can be a storage account key, SQL login password or a password.

   > [!Note]
   > If you use this option, you need to deploy an _Azure key vault_ resource in your subscription and assign _Azure Purview accountâ€™s_ MSI with required access permission to secrets inside _Azure key vault_.

* **Service Principal** - In this method, you can create a new or use an existing service principal in your Azure Active Directory tenant.

### Authentication for a scan

#### Using Managed Identity for scanning

It is important to give your Purview account the permission to scan the ADLS Gen2 data source. You can add the Catalog's MSI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what you want it to have scan permissions on.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a managed identity on an Azure resource.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find either the subscription, resource group, or resource (for example, an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account) that you would like to allow the catalog to scan.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen2/register-adls-gen2-storage-acct.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the storage account":::

1. Click on **Access Control (IAM)** in the left navigation and then click on **+ Add** --> **Add role assignment**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen2/register-adls-gen2-access-control.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the access control for the storage account":::

1. Set the **Role** to **Storage Blob Data Reader** and enter your _Azure Purview account name_ under **Select** input box. Then, select **Save** to give this role assignment to your Purview account.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen2/register-adls-gen2-assign-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details to assign permissions for the Purview account":::

> [!Note]
> For more details, please see steps in [Authorize access to blobs and queues using Azure Active Directory](../storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have firewall enabled for the storage account, you must use **Managed Identity** authentication method when setting up a scan.

1. Go into your ADLS Gen2 storage account in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Navigate to **Security + networking > Networking**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen2/register-adls-gen2-networking.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details to provide firewall access":::

1. Choose **Selected Networks** under **Allow access from**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen2/register-adls-gen2-network-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details to allow access to selected networks":::

1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the key to setup your scan

#### Using Service Principal for scanning

##### Creating a new service principal

If you need to [Create a new service principal](./create-service-principal-azure.md), it is required to register an application in your Azure AD tenant and provide access to Service Principal in your data sources. Your Azure AD Global Administrator or other roles such as Application Administrator can perform this operation.

##### Getting the Service Principal's Application ID

1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** present in the **Overview** of the [_Service Principal_](./create-service-principal-azure.md) already created

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen2/register-adls-gen2-sp-appln-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Application (client) ID for the Service Principal":::

##### Granting the Service Principal access to your ADLS Gen2 account

It is important to give your service principal the permission to scan the ADLS Gen2 data source. You can add the Catalog's MSI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what you want it to have scan permissions on.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a service principal on an Azure resource.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find either the subscription, resource group, or resource (for example, an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account) that you would like to allow the catalog to scan.
