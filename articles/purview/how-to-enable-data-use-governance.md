# Enable data use governance on your Azure Purview sources

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

Data use governance is a feature within your registered Azure Purview resources that lets Azure Purview administrators manage data use from within Azure Purview.

## Prerequisites

To register a data source, resource group, or subscription in Azure Purview with the *Data use Governance* option set, a user needs to have **either one of the following** IAM role combinations on that resource:

- IAM *Owner*
- Both IAM *Contributor* + IAM *User Access Administrator*

Follow this [guide to configure Azure RBAC role permissions](../role-based-access-control/check-access.md).


## Enable data use governance

To enable data use governance for a resource, the resource will first need to be registered in Azure Purview.
To register a resource, follow the **Prerequisites** and **Register** sections of the [source pages](azure-purview-connector-overview.md) for your resources.

Once you have your resource registered, follow the rest of the steps to enable an individual resource for data use governance.

1. Go to the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).

1. Select the **Data map** tab in the left menu.

1. Select the **Sources** tab in the left menu.

1. Select the source you want to enable data use governance for.

1. At the top of the source page, select **Edit source**.

1. Enable the data source for data use governance in Azure Purview by setting the **Data use governance** toggle to **Enabled**, as shown in the image below.

> [!WARNING]
> **Known issues** related to source registration:
>
> - Moving data sources to a different resource group or subscription is not yet supported. If want to do that, de-register the data source in Azure Purview before moving it and then register it again after that happens.
> - Once a subscription gets disabled for *Data use governance* any underlying assets that are enabled for *Data use governance* will be disabled, which is the right behavior. However, policy statements based on those assets will still be allowed after that.


## Disable data use governance

>[!Note]
>If your resource is currently a part of any active access policy, you will not be able to disable data use governance. First [remove the resource from the policy](how-to-data-owner-policy-authoring-generic.md#update-or-delete-a-policy), then disable data use governance.

To disable data use governance for a source, resource group, or subscription, a user needs to either be a data source **Owner** or an Azure Purview **Data source admin**. Once you have those permissions follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).

1. Select the **Data map** tab in the left menu.

1. Select the **Sources** tab in the left menu.

1. Select the source you want to disable data use governance for.

1. At the top of the source page, select **Edit source**.

1. Set the **Data use governance** toggle to **Disabled**.

>[!NOTE]
> Disabling **Data use governance** for a subscription source will disable it also for all assets registered in that subscription.

## Data use governance best practices

- We highly encourage registering data sources for *Data use governance* and managing all associated access policies in a single Azure Purview account.
- Should you have multiple Azure Purview accounts, be aware that **all** data sources belonging to a subscription must be registered for *Data use governance* in a single Azure Purview account. That Azure Purview account can be in any subscription in the tenant. The *Data use governance* toggle will become greyed out when there are invalid configurations. Some examples of valid and invalid configurations follow in the diagram below:
  - **Case 1** shows a valid configuration where a Storage account is registered in an Azure Purview account in the same subscription.
  - **Case 2** shows a valid configuration where a Storage account is registered in an Azure Purview account in a different subscription.
  - **Case 3** shows an invalid configuration arising because Storage accounts S3SA1 and S3SA2 both belong to Subscription 3, but are registered to different Azure Purview accounts. In that case, the *Data use governance* toggle will only work in the Azure Purview account that wins and registers a data source in that subscription first. The toggle will then be greyed out for the other data source.
