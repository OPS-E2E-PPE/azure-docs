|Allowed     |Allowed        |Cross-tenant       |[Self-hosted runtime & Delegated authentication](#cross-power-bi-tenant-registration-and-scan)             |

### Known limitations

-  If Azure Purview or Power BI tenant is protected behind a private endpoint, Self-hosted runtime is the only option to scan
-  Delegated authentication is the only supported authentication option if self-hosted integration runtime is used during the scan
-  For cross-tenant scenario, delegated authentication is only supported option for scanning.
-  You can create only one scan for a Power BI data source that is registered in your Azure Purview account
-  If Power BI dataset schema is not shown after scan, it is due to one of the current limitations with [Power BI Metadata scanner](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-metadata-scanning)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An active [Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

- You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

- If delegated auth is used, make sure proper [Power BI license](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization#subscription-license-types) is assigned to Power BI admin user that is used for the scan.

- If self-hosted integration runtime is used:

  - Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). The minimum required version is 5.14.8055.1. For more information, see[the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).
  
  - Ensure [JDK 8 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html), is installed on the virtual machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed.
  
## Same Power BI tenant registration and scan

### Authentication options 

- Managed Identity 
- Delegated Authentication

### Authenticate to Power BI tenant-managed identity only

> [!Note]
> Follow steps in this section, only if you are planning to use **Managed Identity** as authentication option.

In Azure Active Directory Tenant, where Power BI tenant is located:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for **Azure Active Directory**.
   
2. Create a new security group in your Azure Active Directory, by following [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md).

    > [!Tip]
    > You can skip this step if you already have a security group you want to use.

3. Select **Security** as the **Group Type**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/security-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security group type.":::

4. Add your Azure Purview managed identity to this security group. Select **Members**, then select **+ Add members**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/add-group-member.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to add the catalog's managed instance to group.":::

5. Search for your Azure Purview managed identity and select it.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/add-catalog-to-group-by-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add catalog by searching for its name.":::

    You should see a success notification showing you that it was added.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/success-add-catalog-msi.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing successful addition of  catalog managed identity.":::

### Associate the security group with Power BI tenant

1. Log into the [Power BI admin portal](https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/tenantSettings).
   
2. Select the **Tenant settings** page.

    > [!Important]
    > You need to be a Power BI Admin to see the tenant settings page.

3. Select **Admin API settings** > **Allow service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs (Preview)**.
   
4. Select **Specific security groups**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/allow-service-principals-power-bi-admin.png" alt-text="Image showing how to allow service principals to get read-only Power BI admin API permissions.":::

5. Select **Admin API settings** > **Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata** > Enable the toggle to allow Azure Purview Data Map automatically discover the detailed metadata of Power BI datasets as part of its scans.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you update the Admin API settings on your power bi tenant, wait around 15 minutes before registering a scan and test connection.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-scan-sub-artifacts.png" alt-text="Image showing the Power BI admin portal config to enable subartifact scan.":::

    > [!Caution]
    > When you allow the security group you created (that has your Azure Purview managed identity as a member) to use read-only Power BI admin APIs, you also allow it to access the metadata (e.g. dashboard and report names, owners, descriptions, etc.) for all of your Power BI artifacts in this tenant. Once the metadata has been pulled into the Azure Purview, Azure Purview's permissions, not Power BI permissions, determine who can see that metadata.
  
    > [!Note]
    > You can remove the security group from your developer settings, but the metadata previously extracted won't be removed from the Azure Purview account. You can delete it separately, if you wish.

### Register same Power BI tenant

This section describes how to register a Power BI tenant in Azure Purview for same-tenant scenario.

1. Select the **Data Map** on the left navigation.

1. Then select **Register**.

    Select **Power BI** as your data source.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/select-power-bi-data-source.png" alt-text="Image showing the list of data sources available to choose.":::

1. Give your Power BI instance a friendly name.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-friendly-name.png" alt-text="Image showing Power BI data source-friendly name.":::

    The name must be between 3-63 characters long and must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.  Spaces aren't allowed.

    By default, the system will find the Power BI tenant that exists in the same Azure Active Directory tenant.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-datasource-registered.png" alt-text="Image showing the registered Power BI data source.":::

### Scan same Power BI tenant

#### Scan same tenant using Azure IR and Managed Identity

This is a suitable scenario, if both Azure Purview and Power PI tenant are configured to allow public access in the network settings. 

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. In the Azure Purview Studio, navigate to the **Data map** in the left menu.

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered Power BI source.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

2. Give your scan a name. Then select the option to include or exclude the personal workspaces.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-scan-setup.png" alt-text="Image showing Power BI scan setup.":::
