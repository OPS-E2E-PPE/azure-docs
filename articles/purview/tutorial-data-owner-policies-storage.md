# Access provisioning by data owner to Azure Storage datasets (preview)

This guide describes how a data owner can leverage Azure Purview to enable access to datasets in Azure Storage. At this point, only the following data sources are supported:
- Blob storage
- Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2

> [!Note]
> These capabilities are currently in preview. This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure
Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE [Access policies generic pre-requisites](./includes/access-policies-prerequisites-generic.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Azure Storage specific pre-requisites](./includes/access-policies-prerequisites-storage.md)]

## Configuration
[!INCLUDE [Access policies generic configuration](./includes/access-policies-configuration-generic.md)]

### Register and scan data sources in Azure Purview
Register and scan each data source with Azure Purview to later define access policies. You can follow these guides:

-   [Register and scan Azure Storage Blob - Azure Purview](register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source.md)

-   [Register and scan Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 - Azure Purview](register-scan-adls-gen2.md)

Enable the data source for access policies in Azure Purview by setting the **Data use governance** toggle to enable, as shown in the picture.

## Policy authoring

## Additional information
>[!Important]
> - Publish is a background operation. It can take up to **2 hours** for the changes to be reflected in Storage account(s).

- Policy statements set below container level on a Storage account are supported. If no access has been provided at Storage account level or container level, then the App that will execute the access will need to provide a fully qualified name (i.e., a direct absolute path) to the data object. The following documents show examples of how to do that:
  - [*abfs* for ADLS Gen2](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-use-data-lake-storage-gen2.md#access-files-from-the-cluster)
  - [*az storage blob download* for Blob Storage](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md#download-a-blob)
 - Creating a policy at Storage account level will enable the Subjects to access system containers e.g., *$logs*. If this is undesired, first scan the data source and then create the policy at container or sub-container level.
- The limit for Azure Purview policies that can be enforced by Storage accounts is 100MB per subscription, which roughly equates to 5000 policies.

### Known issues

> [!Warning]
> **Known issues** related to Policy creation
> - Do not create policy statements based on Azure Purview resource sets. Even if displayed in Azure Purview policy authoring UI, they are not yet enforced. Learn more about [resource sets](concept-resource-sets.md).
> - Once subscription gets disabled for *Data use governance* any underlying assets that are enabled for *Data use governance* will be disabled, which is the right behavior. However, policy statements based on those assets will still be allowed after that.

### Policy action mapping

This section contains a reference of how actions in Azure Purview data policies map to specific actions in Azure Storage.

| **Azure Purview policy action** | **Data source specific actions**                                                        |
