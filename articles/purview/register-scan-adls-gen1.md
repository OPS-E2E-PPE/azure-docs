# Connect to Azure Data Lake Gen1 in Azure Purview

This article outlines the process to register an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 data source in Azure Purview including instructions to authenticate and interact with the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 source.

> [!Note]
> Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is now generally available. We recommend that you start using it today. For more information, see the [product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register) | [Yes](#scan)|[Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan)|[Yes](#scan)| No |[Data Factory Lineage](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) |

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

## Register

This section will enable you to register the ADLS Gen1 data source and set up an appropriate authentication mechanism to ensure successful scanning of the data source.

### Steps to register

It is important to register the data source in Azure Purview prior to setting up a scan for the data source.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to the **Purview accounts** page and click on your _Purview account_

## Scan

### Prerequisites for scan

In order to have access to scan the data source, an authentication method in the ADLS Gen1 Storage account needs to be configured.
The following options are supported:

> [!Note]
> If you have firewall enabled for the storage account, you must use Managed Identity authentication method when setting up a scan.

* **Managed Identity (Recommended)** - As soon as the Azure Purview Account is created, a system **Managed Identity** is created automatically in Azure AD tenant. Depending on the type of resource, specific RBAC role assignments are required for the Azure Purview MSI to perform the scans.

* **Service Principal** - In this method, you can create a new or use an existing service principal in your Azure Active Directory tenant.

### Authentication for a scan

#### Using Managed Identity for scanning

It is important to give your Purview account the permission to scan the ADLS Gen1 data source. You can add the Catalog's MSI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what you want it to have scan permissions on.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a managed identity on an Azure resource.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find either the subscription, resource group, or resource (for example, an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 storage account) that you would like to allow the catalog to scan.
1. Click on **Overview** and then select **Data explorer**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-data-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the storage account":::

1. Click on **Access** in the top navigation

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-storage-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Data explorer for the storage account":::

1. Click on **Select** and Add the _Purview Catalog_ in the **Select user or group** selection.
1. Select **Read** and **Execute** permissions. Make sure to choose **This folder and all children**, and **An access permission entry and a default permission entry** in the Add options as shown in the below screenshot. Click on **OK**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-assign-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details to assign permissions for the Purview account":::

> [!Tip]
> An **access permission entry** is a permission entry on _current_ files and folders. A **default permission entry** is a permission entry that will be _inherited_ by new files and folders.
To grant permission only to currently existing files, **choose an access permission entry**.
To grant permission to scan files and folders that will be added in future, **include a default permission entry**.

#### Using Service Principal for scanning

##### Creating a new service principal

If you need to [Create a new service principal](./create-service-principal-azure.md), it is required to register an application in your Azure AD tenant and provide access to Service Principal in your data sources. Your Azure AD Global Administrator or other roles such as Application Administrator can perform this operation.

##### Getting the Service Principal's application ID

1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** present in the **Overview** of the [_Service Principal_](./create-service-principal-azure.md) already created

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-sp-appl-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Application (client) ID for the Service Principal":::

##### Granting the Service Principal access to your ADLS Gen1 account

It is important to give your service principal the permission to scan the ADLS Gen2 data source. You can add the Catalog's MSI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what you want it to have scan permissions on.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a service principal on an Azure resource.

1. Provide the service principal access to the storage account by opening the storage account and clicking on **Overview** --> **Data Explorer**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-data-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the storage account":::

1. Click on **Access** in the top navigation

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-storage-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Data explorer for the storage account":::

1. Click on **Select** and Add the _Service Principal_ in the **Select user or group** selection.
1. Select **Read** and **Execute** permissions. Make sure to choose **This folder and all children**, and **An access permission entry and a default permission entry** in the Add options. Click on **OK**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-adls-gen1/register-adls-gen1-sp-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details to assign permissions for the service principal":::
