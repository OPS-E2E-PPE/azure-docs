\* Besides the lineage on assets within the data source, lineage is also supported if dataset is used as a source/sink in [Data Factory](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) or [Synapse pipeline](how-to-lineage-azure-synapse-analytics.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Azure Purview can't scan an asset that has `/`, `\`, or `#` in its name. To scope your scan and avoid scanning assets that have those characters in the asset name, use the example in [Register and scan an Azure SQL Database](register-scan-azure-sql-database.md#creating-the-scan).

## Scan regions
The following is a list of all the Azure data source (data center) regions where the Azure Purview scanner runs. If your Azure data source is in a region outside of this list, the scanner will run in the region of your Azure Purview instance.
