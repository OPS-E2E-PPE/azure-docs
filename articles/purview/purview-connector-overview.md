\* Purview relies on UPDATE_TIME metadata from Azure Database for MySQL for incremental scans. In some cases, this field might not persist in the database and a full scan is performed. For more information, see [The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-tables-table.html) for MySQL. 

\** Lineage is supported if dataset is used as a source/sink in [Data Factory Copy activity](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Purview can't scan an asset that has `/`, `\`, or `#` in its name. To scope your scan and avoid scanning assets that have those characters in the asset name, use the example in [Register and scan an Azure SQL Database](register-scan-azure-sql-database.md#creating-the-scan).

## Scan regions
The following is a list of all the Azure data source (data center) regions where the Purview scanner runs. If your Azure data source is in a region outside of this list, the scanner will run in the region of your Purview instance.
