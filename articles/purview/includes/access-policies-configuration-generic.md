### Register Microsoft Purview as a resource provider in other subscriptions
Execute this step only if the data sources and the Microsoft Purview account are in different subscriptions. Register Microsoft Purview as a resource provider in each subscription where data sources reside by following this guide: [Register resource provider](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#register-resource-provider).

The Microsoft Purview resource provider is:
```
Microsoft.Purview
```

### Configure permissions for policy management actions
This section discusses the permissions needed to:
- Make a data resource available for *Data Use Management*. This step is needed before a policy can be created in Microsoft Purview for that resource.
- Author and publish policies in Microsoft Purview.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, Microsoft Purview roles related to policy operations must be configured at **root collection level** and not child collection level.

#### Permissions to make a data resource available for *Data Use Management*
To enable the *Data Use Management* (DUM) toggle for a data source, resource group, or subscription, the same user needs to have both certain IAM privileges on the resource and certain Microsoft Purview privileges. 

1) User needs to have **either one of the following** IAM role combinations on the resource's ARM path or any parent of it (using inheritance).
   - IAM *Owner*
   - Both IAM *Contributor* + IAM *User Access Administrator*

   Follow this [guide to configure Azure RBAC role permissions](../../role-based-access-control/check-access.md). The following screenshot shows how to access the Access Control section in Azure portal experience for the data resource to add a role assignment:

2) In addition, the same user needs to have Microsoft Purview Data source administrator (DSA) role at the **root collection level**. See the guide on [managing Microsoft Purview role assignments](../catalog-permissions.md#assign-permissions-to-your-users). The following screenshot shows how to assign Data Source Admin at root collection level:

#### Permissions for policy authoring and publishing
The following permissions are needed in Microsoft Purview at the **root collection level**:
- *Policy authors* role can create or edit policies.
- *Data source administrator* role can publish a policy.

Check the section on managing Microsoft Purview role assignments in this [guide](../how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-roles-and-restrict-access-through-collections).

>[!WARNING]
> **Known issues** related to permissions
> - In addition to Microsoft Purview *Policy authors* role, user requires *Directory Reader* permission in Azure Active Directory to create data owner policy. Learn more about permissions for [Azure AD Directory Reader](../../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md#directory-readers)

#### Delegation of access control responsibility to Microsoft Purview

>[!WARNING]
> - IAM Owner role for a data source can be inherited from parent resource group, subscription or subscription Management Group. 
> - Once a resource has been enabled for *Data Use Management*, **any** Microsoft Purview root-collection *policy author* will be able to create access policies against it, and **any** Microsoft Purview root-collection *Data source admin* will be able to publish those policies at **any point afterwards**.
> - **Any** Microsoft Purview root *Collection admin* can assign **new** root-collection *Data Source Admin* and *Policy author* roles.

With these warnings in mind, here are some **suggested best practices for permissions:**
- Minimize the number of people that hold Microsoft Purview root *Collection admin*, root *Data Source Admin* or root *Policy author* roles.
- To ensure check and balances, assign the Microsoft Purview *Policy author* and *Data source admin* roles to different people in the organization. With this, before a data policy takes effect, a second person (the *Data source admin*) must review it and explicitly approve it by publishing it.
