# Azure Purview deployment checklist

This article lists prerequisites that help you get started quickly on Azure Purview planning and deployment.

|No.  |Prerequisite / Action  |Required permission  |Additional guidance and recommendations  |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|1    | Azure Active Directory Tenant        |N/A         |An [Azure Active Directory tenant](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) should be associated with your subscription. <ul><li>*Global Administrator* or *Information Protection Administrator* role is required, if you plan to [extend Microsoft 365 Sensitivity Labels to Azure Purview for files and db columns](create-sensitivity-label.md)</li><li> *Global Administrator* or *Power BI Administrator* role is required, if you're planning to [scan Power BI tenants](register-scan-power-bi-tenant.md).</li></ul>         |
|2     |An active Azure Subscription          |*Subscription Owner*         |An Azure subscription is needed to deploy Azure Purview and its managed resources. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.          |
|3     |Define whether you plan to deploy an Azure Purview with managed Event Hub      |  N/A |A managed Event Hub is created as part of Azure Purview account creation, see Azure Purview account creation. You can publish messages to the Event Hub kafka topic ATLAS_HOOK and Azure Purview will consume and process it. Azure Purview will notify entity changes to Event Hub kafka topic ATLAS_ENTITIES and user can consume and process it.      |  
|4     |Register the following resource providers: <ul><li>Microsoft.Storage</li><li>Microsoft.EventHub (optional)</li><li>Microsoft.Purview</li></ul>       |*Subscription Owner* or custom role to register Azure resource providers (_/register/action_)         | [Register required Azure Resource Providers](/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md) in the Azure Subscription that is designated for Azure Purview Account. Review [Azure resource provider operations](../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md).          |
|5     |Update Azure Policy to allow deployment of the following resources in your Azure subscription: <ul><li>Azure Purview</li><li>Azure Storage</li><li>Azure Event Hub (optional)</li></ul>            |*Subscription Owner*          |Use this step if an existing Azure Policy prevents deploying such Azure resources. If a blocking policy exists and needs to remain in place, please follow our [Azure Purview exception tag guide](create-azure-purview-portal-faq.md) and follow the steps to create an exception for Azure Purview accounts.          |
|6     | Define your network security requirements.     | Network and Security architects.         |<ul><li> Review [Azure Purview network architecture and best practices](concept-best-practices-network.md) to define what scenario is more relevant to your network requirements. </li><li>If private network is needed, use [Azure Purview Managed IR](catalog-managed-vnet.md) to scan Azure data sources when possible to reduce complexity and administrative overhead. </li></ul>  |
|7     |An Azure Virtual Network and Subnet(s) for Azure Purview private endpoints.         | *Network Contributor* to create or update Azure VNet.         |Use this step if you're planning to deploy [private endpoint connectivity with Azure Purview](catalog-private-link.md):  <ul><li>Private endpoints for **Ingestion**.</li><li>Private endpoint for Azure Purview **Account**.</li><li>Private endpoint for Azure Purview **Portal**.</li></ul> <br> Deploy [Azure Virtual Network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) if you need one.      |
|8     |Deploy private endpoint for Azure data sources.      |*Network Contributor* to set up private endpoints for each data source.         |Perform this step, if you're planning to use [Private Endpoint for Ingestion](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md).          |
|9     |Define whether to deploy new or use existing Azure Private DNS Zones.         |Required [Azure Private DNS Zones](catalog-private-link-name-resolution.md) can be created automatically during Purview Account deployment using Subscription Owner / Contributor role         |Use this step if you're planning to use Private Endpoint connectivity with Azure Purview. Required DNS Zones for Private Endpoint: <ul><li>privatelink.purview.azure.com</li><li>privatelink.purviewstudio.azure.com</li><li>privatelink.blob.core.windows.net</li><li>privatelink.queue.core.windows.net</li><li>privatelink.servicebus.windows.net</li></ul>        |
|10     |A management machine in your CorpNet or inside Azure VNet to launch Azure Purview Studio.         |N/A         |Use this step if you're planning to set **Allow Public Network** to **deny** on your Azure Purview Account.         |
|11     |Deploy an Azure Purview Account         |Subscription Owner / Contributor         |Purview account is deployed with 1 Capacity Unit and will scale up based [on demand](concept-elastic-data-map.md).          |
|12     |Deploy a Managed Integration Runtime and Managed private endpoints for Azure data sources.      |*Data source admin* to setup Managed VNet inside Azure Purview. <br> *Network Contributor* to approve managed private endpoint for each Azure data source.         |Perform this step if you're planning to use [Managed VNet](catalog-managed-vnet.md). within your Azure Purview account for scanning purposes.          |
|13     |Deploy Self-hosted integration runtime VMs inside your network.         |Azure: *Virtual Machine Contributor* <br> On-prem: Application owner         |Use this step if you're planning to perform any scans using [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](manage-integration-runtimes.md).          |
