# Run commands in Azure VMware Solution

In Azure VMware Solution, you'll get vCenter access with CloudAdmin role. You can [view the privileges granted](concepts-identity.md#view-the-vcenter-privileges) to the Azure VMware Solution CloudAdmin role on your Azure VMware Solution private cloud vCenter. Run commands are a collection of PowerShell cmdlets that you do certain operations on vCenter, which requires elevated privileges. 

Azure VMware Solution supports the following operations:

- [Install and uninstall JetStream DR solution](deploy-disaster-recovery-using-jetstream.md)

- [Configure an external identity source](configure-identity-source-vcenter.md)

- [View and edit the storage policy](configure-storage-policy.md) 


>[!NOTE]
>Run commands are executed one at a time in the order submitted.

## View the status of an execution

You can view the status of any run command executed, including the output, errors, warnings, and information.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Run command** > **Run execution status**.

   You can sort by the execution name, package name, package version, command name, start time, end time, and status.

1. Select the execution you want to view.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-execution-status-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example of a run execution.":::

   You can view more details about the execution including the output, errors, warnings, and information.

   - **Details** - Summary of the execution details, such as the name, status, package, and command name ran. 

   - **Output** - Message at the end of successful execution of a cmdlet. Not all cmdlets have output.

      :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-execution-status-example-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the output of a run execution.":::

   - **Error** - Terminating exception that stopped the execution of a cmdlet.    

      :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-execution-status-example-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the errors detected during the execution of an execution.":::

   - **Warning** - Non-Terminating exception occurred during the execution of a cmdlet. 

      :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-execution-status-example-warning.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the warnings detected during the execution of an execution.":::

   - **Information** - Progress message during the execution of a cmdlet.

## Cancel or delete a job



### Method 1

>[!NOTE]
>Method 1 is irreversible.

1. Select **Run command** > **Run execution status** and then select the job you want to cancel.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-execution-cancel-delete-job-method-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to cancel and delete a run command.":::

2. Select **Yes** to cancel and remove the job for all users.



### Method 2

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Run execution status**.

2. Select **More** (...) for the job you want to cancel and delete.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-execution-cancel-delete-job-method-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to cancel and delete a run command using the ellipsis.":::

3. Select **Yes** to cancel and remove the job for all users.



## Next steps

Now that you've learned about the Run command concepts, you can use the Run command feature to:

- [Configure storage policy](configure-storage-policy.md) - Each VM deployed to a vSAN datastore is assigned at least one VM storage policy. You can assign a VM storage policy in an initial deployment of a VM or when you perform other VM operations, such as cloning or migrating.

- [Configure external identity source for vCenter](configure-identity-source-vcenter.md) - vCenter has a built-in local user called cloudadmin and assigned to the CloudAdmin role. The local cloudadmin user is used to set up users in Active Directory (AD). With the Run command feature, you can configure Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS for vCenter as an external identity source.

- [Deploy disaster recovery using JetStream](deploy-disaster-recovery-using-jetstream.md) - Store data directly to a recovery cluster in vSAN. The data gets captured through I/O filters that run within vSphere. The underlying data store can be VMFS, VSAN, vVol, or any HCI platform.
