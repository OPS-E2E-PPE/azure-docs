# Send data to Azure Monitor workspace from the Prometheus server in your Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster

Azure Red Hat OpenShift comes preinstalled with a default Prometheus server. As per the [support policy](support-policies-v4.md), this default Prometheus server shouldn't be removed. Some scenarios need to centralize data from self-managed Prometheus clusters for long-term data retention to create a centralized view across your clusters. Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus allows you to collect and analyze metrics at scale using a Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution based on the [Prometheus](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio) project from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. You can use [remote_write](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage) to send data from the in-cluster Prometheus servers to the Azure managed service.

## Prerequisites
- Data for Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus is stored in an [Azure Monitor workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). You must [create a new workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage.md#create-an-azure-monitor-workspace) if you don't already have one.

## Create Microsoft Entra ID application
Follow the procedure at [Register an application with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal) to register an application for Prometheus remote-write and create a service principal.

1. Copy the tenant ID and client ID of the created service principal.
    1. Browse to **Identity > Applications > App registrations**, then select your application.
    1. On the overview page for the app, copy the Directory (tenant) ID value and store it in your application code.
    1. Copy the Application (client) ID value and store it in your application code.
    
1. Create a new client secret as directed in [Create new client secret](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret).Copy the value of the created secret.

1. Set the values of the collected tenant ID, client ID and client secret:

    ```
    export TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
    export CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
    export CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
    ```
    
## Assign Monitoring Metrics Publisher role to the application

The application requires the *Monitoring Metrics Publisher* role on the data collection rule associated with your Azure Monitor workspace.

1. From the menu of your Azure Monitor Workspace account, select the **Data collection rule** to open the **Overview** page for the data collection rule.

2. On the **Overview** page, select **Access control (IAM)**.

3. Select **Add**, and then select **Add role assignment**.

4. Select **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role, and then select **Next**.

5. Select **User, group, or service principal**, and then select **Select members**. Select the application that you created and select **Select**.

6. Select **Review + assign** to complete the role assignment.

## Create secret in the ARO cluster

To authenticate with a remote write endpoint, the OAuth 2.0 authentication method from the [supported remote write authentication settings](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.html#supported_remote_write_authentication_settings_configuring-the-monitoring-stack) is used. To facilitate this approach, create a secret with the client ID and client secret:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: oauth2-credentials
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
stringData:
  id: "${CLIENT_ID}"
  secret: "${CLIENT_SECRET}"
EOF
```
  
## Configure remote write

To [configure](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.html#configuring_remote_write_storage_configuring-the-monitoring-stack) remote write for default platform monitoring, update the *cluster-monitoring-config* config map in the openshift-monitoring namespace.

1. Open the config map for editing:

    ```
    oc edit -n openshift-monitoring cm cluster-monitoring-config
    ```
    
    ```
    data:
      config.yaml: |
        prometheusK8s:
          remoteWrite:
            - url: "<INGESTION-URL>"
              oauth2:
                clientId:
                  secret:
                    name: oauth2-credentials
                    key: id
                clientSecret:
                  name: oauth2-credentials
                  key: secret
                tokenUrl: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token"
                scopes:
                  - "https://monitor.azure.com/.default"
    ```
    
1. Update the configuration.

    1. Replace `INGESTION-URL` in the configuration with the **Metrics ingestion endpoint** from the **Overview** page for the Azure Monitor workspace.
    
    1. Replace `TENANT_ID` in the configuration with the tenant ID of the service principal.


## Visualize metrics using Azure Managed Grafana Workspace

The captured metrics can be visualized using community Grafana dashboards, or you can create contextual dashboards as required.

1. Create an [Azure Managed Grafana workspace](../managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-portal.md).

1. [Link](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage.md?tabs=azure-portal#link-a-grafana-workspace) the created Grafana workspace to the Azure Monitor workspace.

1. [Import](../managed-grafana/how-to-create-dashboard.md?tabs=azure-portal#import-a-grafana-dashboard) the community Grafana Dashboard with ID 3870 [OpenShift/K8 Cluster Overview](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/3870-openshift-k8-cluster-overview/) into the Grafana workspace.

1. Specify the Azure Monitor workspace as the data source.

1. Save the dashboard.

1. Access the dashboard from **Home -> Dashboards**.
