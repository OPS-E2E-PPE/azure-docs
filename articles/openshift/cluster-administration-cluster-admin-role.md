# Azure Red Hat OpenShift customer administrator role

As an ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift) cluster administrator of an OpenShift cluster, your account has increased permissions and access to all user-created projects.

When your account has the osa-customer-admins authorization role bound to it, it can automatically manage a project.

> [!Note] 
> osa-customer-admin clusterrole is not the same as cluster-admin clusterrole


For example, you can execute actions associated with a set of verbs (`create`) to operate on a set of resource names (`templates`). To view the details of these roles and their sets of verbs and resources, run the following command:

`$ oc describe clusterrole/osa-customer-admin`

The verb names do not necessarily all map directly to oc commands, but rather equate more generally to the types of CLI operations you can perform. For example, having the `list` verb means that you can display a list of all objects of a given resource name (`oc get`), while the `get` verb means that you can display the details of a specific object if you know its name (`oc describe`).

## How to configure customer administrator role

Customer administrator role can be configured only during cluster creation by providing flag `--customer-admin-group-id`.
