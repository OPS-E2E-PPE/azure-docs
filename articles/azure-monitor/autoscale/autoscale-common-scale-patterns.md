# Overview of common autoscale patterns

Autoscale settings help ensure that you have the right amount of resources running to handle the fluctuating load of your application. You can configure autoscale settings to be triggered based on metrics that indicate load or performance, or triggered at a scheduled date and time. 

Azure autoscale supports many resource types. For more information about supported resources, see [autoscale supported resources](./autoscale-overview.md#supported-services-for-autoscale).

This article describes some of the common patterns you can use to scale your resources in Azure.
## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you're familiar with auto scale. [Get started here to scale your resource](./autoscale-get-started.md). 

## Scale based on metrics

Scale your resource based on metrics produce by the resource itself or any other resource.
For example:
* Scale your Virtual Machine Scale Set based on the CPU usage of the virtual machine.
* Ensure a minimum number of instances.
* Set a maximum limit on the number of instances.  

The image below shows a default scale condition for a Virtual Machine Scale Set
 * The **Scale rule** tab shows that the metric source is the scale set itself and the metric used is Percentage CPU.
 * The minimum number of instances running is set to 2.
 * The maximum number of instances is set to 10.
 * When the scale set starts, the default number of instances is 3.

## Scale based on another resource's metric

Scale a resource based on the metrics from a different resource.  
The image below shows a scale rule that is scaling a Virtual Machine Scale Set based on the number of allocated ports on a load balancer.

## Scale differently on weekends

You can scale your resources differently on different days of the week.
For example, you have a Virtual Machine Scale Set and want to:
- Set a minimum of 3 instances on weekdays, scaling based on inbound flows.
- Scale-in to a fixed 1 instance on weekends when there's less traffic.

In this example:
+ The weekend profile starts at 00:01, Saturday morning and ends at 04:00 on Monday morning.
+ The end times are left blank. The weekday profile will end when the weekend profile starts and vice-versa.
+ There's no need for a default profile as there's no time that isn't covered by the other profiles.

## Scale differently during specific events

You can set your scale rules and instance limits differently for specific events.  
For example: 
- Set a minimum of 3 instances by default
- For the week of Back Friday, set the minimum number of instances to 10 to handle the anticipated traffic.

## Scale based on custom metrics
Scale by custom metrics generated by your application.  
For example, you have a web front end and an API tier that communicates with the backend, and you want to scale the API tier based on custom events in the front end.
