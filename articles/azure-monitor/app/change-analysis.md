# Azure Monitor application change analysis (public preview)

When a live site issue/outage occurs, determining root cause quickly is critical. Standard monitoring solutions may help you rapidly identify that there is a problem, and often even which component is failing. But this won't always lead to an immediate explanation for why the failure is occurring. Your site worked five minutes ago, now it's broken. What changed in the last five minutes? This is the question that the new feature Azure Monitor application change analysis is designed to answer. By building on the power of the [Azure Resource Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) application change analysis provides insight into your Azure App Service application changes to increase observability and reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Repair).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Monitor application change analysis is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## How do I use application change analysis?

Azure Monitor application change analysis is currently built into the self-service **Diagnose and solve problems** experience, which can be accessed from the **Overview** section of your Azure App Service application:

### Enable change analysis

1. Select **Availability and Performance**

2. Click the **Application Crashes** tile.

3. To enable **Change Analysis** select **Enable now**.

4. To take advantage of the full change analysis functionality set **Change Analysis**, **Scan for code changes**, and **Always on** to **On** and select **Save**.

    If **Change Analysis** is enabled, you will be able to detect resource level changes. If **Scan for code changes** is enabled, you will also see deployment files and site configuration changes. Enabling **Always on** will optimize the change scanning performance, but may incur additional costs from a billing perspective.

5.  Once everything  is enabled, selecting **Diagnose and solve problems** > **Availability and Performance** > **Application Crashes** will allow you to access the change analysis experience. The graph will summerize the type of changes that happened over time along with details on those changes:

     > [!NOTE]
     > After enabling change analysis you mayT receive a message stating "Unable to fetch Change Analysis information. Please try again later." This is expected, you may need to wait up to 4 hours for the initial collection of application change data to occur.
