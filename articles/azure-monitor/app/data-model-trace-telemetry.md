# Trace telemetry: Application Insights data model

Trace telemetry in [Application Insights](./app-insights-overview.md) represents `printf`-style trace statements that are text searched. `Log4Net`, `NLog`, and other text-based log file entries are translated into instances of this type. The trace doesn't have measurements as an extensibility.

## Message

Trace message.

**Maximum length**: 32,768 characters

## Severity level

Trace severity level.

**Values**: `Verbose`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, and `Critical`

## Custom properties

[!INCLUDE [application-insights-data-model-properties](../../../includes/application-insights-data-model-properties.md)]
