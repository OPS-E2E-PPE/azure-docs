# Data collection rules in Azure Monitor
[Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md) provide an [ETL](/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/etl)-like pipeline in Azure Monitor, allowing you to define the way that data coming into Azure Monitor should be handled. Depending on the type of workflow, DCRs may specify where data should be sent and may filter or transform data before it's stored in Azure Monitor Logs. Some data collection rules will be created and managed by Azure Monitor, while you may create others to customize data collection for your particular requirements. This article describes DCRs including their contents and structure and how you can create and work with them.

## Types of data collection rules
There are currently two types of data collection rule in Azure Monitor:

- **Standard DCR**. Used with different workflows that send data to Azure Monitor. Workflows currently supported are [Azure Monitor agent](../agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md) and [custom logs (preview)](../logs/custom-logs-overview.md).

- **Workspace transformation DCR)**. Used with a Log Analytics workspace to apply [ingestion-time transformations (preview)](../logs/ingestion-time-transformations.md) to workflows that don't currently support DCRs.

## Structure of a data collection rule
Data collection rules are formatted in JSON. While you may not need to interact with them directly, there are scenarios where you may need to directly edit a data collection rule. See [Data collection rule structure](data-collection-rule-structure.md) for a description of this structure and different elements.

## Permissions 
When using programmatic methods to create data collection rules and associations, you require the following permissions:  

| Built-in Role | Scope(s) | Reason |  
|:---|:---|:---|  
| [Monitoring Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#monitoring-contributor) | <ul><li>Subscription and/or</li><li>Resource group and/or </li><li>An existing data collection rule</li></ul> | Create or edit data collection rules |
| [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor)<br>[Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-connected-machine-resource-administrator)</li></ul> | <ul><li>Virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets</li><li>Arc-enabled servers</li></ul> | Deploy associations (i.e. to assign rules to the machine) |
| Any role that includes the action *Microsoft.Resources/deployments/** | <ul><li>Subscription and/or</li><li>Resource group and/or </li><li>An existing data collection rule</li></ul> | Deploy ARM templates |

## Limits
For limits that apply to each data collection rule, see [Azure Monitor service limits](../service-limits.md#data-collection-rules).

## Creating a data collection rule
The following articles describe different scenarios for creating data collection rules. In some cases, the data collection rule may be created for you, while in others you may need to create and edit it yourself. 

| Workflow | Resources |
|:---|:---|
| Azure Monitor agent | [Configure data collection for the Azure Monitor agent](../agents/data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md)<br>[Use Azure Policy to install Azure Monitor agent and associate with DCR](../agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#using-azure-policy) |
| Custom logs | [Configure custom logs using the Azure portal](../logs/tutorial-custom-logs.md)<br>[Configure custom logs using Resource Manager templates and REST API](../logs/tutorial-custom-logs-api.md) |
| Workspace transformation | [Configure ingestion-time transformations using the Azure portal](../logs/tutorial-ingestion-time-transformations.md)<br>[Configure ingestion-time transformations using Resource Manager templates and REST API](../logs/tutorial-ingestion-time-transformations-api.md) |


## Programmatically work with DCRs
See the following resources for programmatically working with DCRs.

- Directly edit the data collection rule in JSON and [submit using the REST API](/rest/api/monitor/datacollectionrules).
- Create DCR and associations with [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/blob/master/src/monitor-control-service/README.md).
- Create DCR and associations with Azure PowerShell.

## Data resiliency and high availability
A rule gets created and stored in the region you specify, and is backed up to the [paired-region](../../availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure.md#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies) within the same geography. The service is deployed to all three [availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md#availability-zones) within the region, making it a **zone-redundant service** which further adds to high availability.

## Supported regions
Data collection rules are stored regionally, and are available in all public regions where Log Analytics is supported, as well as the Azure Government and China clouds. Air-gapped clouds are not yet supported.

### Single region data residency
This is a preview feature to enable storing customer data in a single region is currently only available in the Southeast Asia Region (Singapore) of the Asia Pacific Geo and Brazil South (Sao Paulo State) Region of Brazil Geo. Single region residency is enabled by default in these regions.
