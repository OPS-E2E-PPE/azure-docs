# Activity logs insights (Preview)

Activity logs insights let you view information about changes to resources and resource groups in a subscription. The dashboards also present data about which users or services performed activities in the subscription and the activities' status. This article explains how to view Activity log insights in the Azure portal.

Before using Activity log insights, you'll have to [enable sending logs to your Log Analytics workspace](./diagnostic-settings.md).

## How does Activity logs insights work?

Activity logs you send to a [Log Analytics workspace](/articles/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md) are stored in a table called AzureActivity. 

Activity logs insights are a curated [Log Analytics workbook](/articles/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) with dashboards that visualize the data in the AzureActivity table. For example, which administrators deleted, updated or created resources, and whether the activities failed or succeeded.
