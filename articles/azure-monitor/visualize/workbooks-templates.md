# Azure Workbook templates

Workbook templates are curated reports designed for flexible reuse by multiple users and teams. Opening a template creates a transient workbook populated with the content of the template. Workbooks are visible in green and Workbook templates are visible in purple. 

You can adjust the template-based workbook parameters and perform analysis without fear of breaking the future reporting experience for colleagues. If you open a template, make some adjustments, and then select the save icon, you will be saving the template as a workbook, which would then show in green,  leaving the original template untouched.

The design and architecture of templates is also different from saved workbooks. Saving a workbook creates an associated Azure Resource Manager resource, whereas the transient workbook created when opening a template doesn't have a unique resource associated with it.  The resources associated with a workbook affect who has access to that workbook. Learn more about [Azure workbooks access control](workbooks-overview.md#access-control).

## Explore a workbook template

Select **Application Failure Analysis** to see one of the default application workbook templates.

Opening the template creates a temporary workbook for you to be able to interact with. By default, the workbook opens in reading mode, which displays only the information for the intended analysis experience created by the original template author.

You can adjust the subscription, targeted apps, and the time range of the data you want to display. Once you have made those selections, the grid of HTTP Requests is also interactive, and selecting an individual row changes the data rendered in the two charts at the bottom of the report.

## Editing a template

To understand how this workbook template is put together, you need to swap to editing mode by selecting **Edit**.

Once you have switched to editing mode, you will notice **Edit** boxes to the right, corresponding with each individual aspect of your workbook.

If we select the edit button immediately under the grid of request data, we can see that this part of our workbook consists of a Kusto query against data from an Application Insights resource.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/workbooks-overview/kusto.png" alt-text="Screenshot of underlying Kusto query." border="false" lightbox="./media/workbooks-overview/kusto.png":::

Selecting the other **Edit** buttons on the right will reveal some of the core components that make up workbooks like markdown-based [text boxes](../visualize/workbooks-text-visualizations.md), [parameter selection](../visualize/workbooks-parameters.md) UI elements, and other [chart/visualization types](workbooks-visualizations.md).

Exploring the pre-built templates in edit-mode and then modifying them to fit your needs and save your own custom workbook is an excellent way to start to learn about what is possible with Azure Monitor workbooks.
