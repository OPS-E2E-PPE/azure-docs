# Configure remote write for Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus using Microsoft Entra authentication
This article describes how to configure [remote-write](prometheus-remote-write.md) to send data from self-managed Prometheus running in your AKS cluster or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster using Microsoft Entra authentication.

## Cluster configurations
This article applies to the following cluster configurations:

- Azure Kubernetes service (AKS)
- Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster
- Kubernetes cluster running in another cloud or on-premises

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure Kubernetes service (AKS) or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, managed identify authentication is recommended. See [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus remote write - managed identity](prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity.md).

## Prerequisites
See prerequisites at [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus remote write](prometheus-remote-write.md#prerequisites).

<a name='create-azure-active-directory-application'></a>

## Create Microsoft Entra application
Follow the procedure at [Register an application with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal) to register an application for Prometheus remote-write and create a service principal.

## Get the client ID of the Microsoft Entra application.

1. From the **Microsoft Entra ID** menu in the Azure portal, select **App registrations**.
2. Locate your application and note the client ID.

## Assign Monitoring Metrics Publisher role on the data collection rule to the application
The application requires the *Monitoring Metrics Publisher* role on the data collection rule associated with your Azure Monitor workspace.

1. From the menu of your Azure Monitor Workspace account, select the **Data collection rule** to open the **Overview** page for the data collection rule.

2. Select **Access control (IAM)** in the **Overview** page for the data collection rule.

3. Select **Add** and then **Add role assignment**.

4. Select **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role and select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing list of role assignments." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/add-role-assignment.png":::

5. Select **User, group, or service principal** and then select **Select members**. Select the application that you created and click **Select**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-active-directory/select-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selection of application." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-active-directory/select-application.png":::

6. Select **Review + assign** to complete the role assignment.


## Create an Azure key vault and generate certificate

1. If you don't already have an Azure key vault, then create a new one using the guidance at [Create a vault](../../key-vault/general/quick-create-portal.md#create-a-vault).
2. Create a certificate using the guidance at [Add a certificate to Key Vault](../../key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal.md#add-a-certificate-to-key-vault).
3. Download the newly generated certificate in CER format using the guidance at [Export certificate from Key Vault](../../key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal.md#export-certificate-from-key-vault).

<a name='add-certificate-to-the-azure-active-directory-application'></a>

## Add certificate to the Microsoft Entra application

1. From the menu for your Microsoft Entra application, select **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Select **Upload certificate** and select the certificate that you downloaded.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-active-directory/upload-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing upload of certificate for Microsoft Entra application." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-active-directory/upload-certificate.png":::

> [!WARNING]
> Certificates have an expiration date, and it's the responsibility of the user to keep these certificates valid.

## Add CSI driver and storage for cluster

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Key Vault CSI driver configuration is just one of the ways to get certificate mounted on the pod. The remote write container only needs a local path to a certificate in the pod for the setting `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` value in the [Deploy Side car and configure remote write on the Prometheus server](#deploy-side-car-and-configure-remote-write-on-the-prometheus-server) step below.

This step is only required if you didn't enable Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver when you created your cluster.

1. Run the following Azure CLI command to enable Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver for your cluster.

    ```azurecli
    az aks enable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --name <aks-cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
    ```

2. Run the following commands to give the identity access to the key vault.

    ```azurecli
    # show client id of the managed identity of the cluster
    az aks show -g <resource-group> -n <cluster-name> --query addonProfiles.azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider.identity.clientId -o tsv

    # set policy to access keys in your key vault
    az keyvault set-policy -n <keyvault-name> --key-permissions get --spn <identity-client-id>

    # set policy to access secrets in your key vault
    az keyvault set-policy -n <keyvault-name> --secret-permissions get --spn <identity-client-id>
    
    # set policy to access certs in your key vault
    az keyvault set-policy -n <keyvault-name> --certificate-permissions get --spn <identity-client-id>
    ```

3. Create a *SecretProviderClass* by saving the following YAML to a file named *secretproviderclass.yml*. Replace the values for `userAssignedIdentityID`, `keyvaultName`, `tenantId` and the objects to retrieve from your key vault. See [Provide an identity to access the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver](../../aks/csi-secrets-store-identity-access.md) for details on values to use.

    [!INCLUDE [secret-provider-class-yaml](../includes/secret-procider-class-yaml.md)]

4. Apply the *SecretProviderClass* by running the following command on your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f secretproviderclass.yml
    ```

## Deploy Side car and configure remote write on the Prometheus server

1. Copy the YAML below and save to a file. This YAML assumes you're using 8081 as your listening port. Modify that value if you use a different port.

    [!INCLUDE [prometheus-sidecar-remote-write-entra-yaml](../includes/prometheus-sidecar-remote-write-entra-yaml.md)]

2. Replace the following values in the YAML.

    | Value | Description |
    |:---|:---|
    | `<CLUSTER-NAME>` | Name of your AKS cluster |
    | `<CONTAINER-IMAGE-VERSION>` | `mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/prometheus/promdev/prom-remotewrite:prom-remotewrite-20230906.1`<br>The remote write container image version.   |
    | `<INGESTION-URL>` | **Metrics ingestion endpoint** from the **Overview** page for the Azure Monitor workspace |
    | `<APP-REGISTRATION -CLIENT-ID> ` | Client ID of your application |
    | `<TENANT-ID> ` | Tenant ID of the Microsoft Entra application |
    | `<CERT-NAME>` | Name of the certificate  |
    | `<CLUSTER-NAME>` | Name of the cluster Prometheus is running on |

    



3. Open Azure Cloud Shell and upload the YAML file.
4. Use helm to apply the YAML file to update your Prometheus configuration with the following CLI commands. 

    ```azurecli
    # set context to your cluster 
    az aks get-credentials -g <aks-rg-name> -n <aks-cluster-name> 
 
    # use helm to update your remote write config 
    helm upgrade -f <YAML-FILENAME>.yml prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -namespace <namespace where Prometheus pod resides> 
    ```
