#Customer-intent: As a Log Analytics workspace administrator, I want to know when there are latency issues in a Log Analytics workspace, so I can act to resolve the issue, contact Microsoft for support, or track that is Azure is meeting its SLA.

# Monitor Log Analytics workspace health

[Azure Service Health](../../service-health/overview.md) monitors the health of your cloud resources, including Log Analytics workspaces. When a Log Analytics workspace is healthy, data you collect from resources in your IT environment is available for querying and analysis in a relatively short period of time, known as [latency](../logs/data-ingestion-time.md). This article explains how to view the health status of your Log Analytics workspace and set up alerts to track Log Analytics workspace health status changes.  

Azure Service Health monitors:

- [Resource health](../../service-health/resource-health-overview.md): information about the health of your individual cloud resources, such as a specific Log Analytics workspace. 
- [Service health](../../service-health/service-health-overview.md): information about the health of the Azure services and regions you're using, which might affect your Log Analytics workspace, including communications about outages, planned maintenance activities, and other health advisories.

## View Log Analytics workspace health and set up health status alerts 

When Azure Service Health detects [average latency](../logs/data-ingestion-time.md#average-latency) in your Log Analytics workspace, the workspace resource health status is **Available**.

To view your Log Analytics workspace health and set up health status alerts:
 
1. Select **Resource health** from the Log Analytics workspace menu.

    The **Resource health** screen shows:

    - **Health history**: Indicates whether Azure Service Health has detected latency issues related to the specific Log Analytics workspace. To further investigate latency issues related to your workspace, see [Investigate latency](#investigate-log-analytics-workspace-health-issues).  
    - **Azure service issues**: Displayed when a known issue with an Azure service might affect latency in the Log Analytics workspace. Select the message to view details about the service issue in Azure Service Health.
   
    > [!NOTE]
    > Service health notifications do not indicate that your Log Analytics workspace is necessarily affected by the know service issue. If your Log Analytics workspace resource health status is **Available**, Azure Service Health did not detect issues in your workspace.

1. To set up health status alerts, you can either [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert](../alerts/alerts-overview.md#recommended-alert-rules) rules, or manually create new alert rules.
    - To enable the recommended alert rules:
        1. select **Alerts**, then select **Enable recommended alert rules**. The **Enable recommended alert rules** pane opens with a list of recommended alert rules based on your type of resource.  
        1. In the **Alert me if** section, select all of the rules you want to enable. The rules are populated with the default values for the rule condition, you can change the default values if you would like.
        1. In the **Notify me by** section, select the way you want to be notified if an alert is fired.
        1. Select **Use an existing action group**, and enter the details of the existing action group if you want to use an action group that already exists.
        1. Select **Enable**.

    - To create a new alert rule:
       1. Select **Add resource health alert**.
        
            The **Create alert rule** wizard opens, with the **Scope** and **Condition** panes pre-populated. By default, the rule triggers alerts all status changes in all Log Analytics workspaces in the subscription. If necessary, you can edit and modify the scope and condition at this stage.

       1. Follow the rest of the steps in [Create a new alert rule in the Azure portal](../alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md#create-a-new-alert-rule-in-the-azure-portal). 
## Investigate Log Analytics workspace health issues

To investigate Log Analytics workspace health issues:

- Use [Log Analytics Workspace Insights](../logs/log-analytics-workspace-insights-overview.md), which provides a unified view of your workspace usage, performance, health, agent, queries, and change log.
- Query the data in your Log Analytics workspace to [understand which factors are contributing greater than expected latency in your workspace](../logs/data-ingestion-time.md).  
- [Use the `_LogOperation` function to view and set up alerts about operational issues](../logs/monitor-workspace.md) logged in your Log Analytics workspace.
