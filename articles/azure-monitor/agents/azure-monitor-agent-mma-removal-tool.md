# MMA Discovery and Removal Tool (Preview)
After you migrate your machines to AMA, you need to remove the MMA agent to avoid duplication of logs. AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility can centrally remove MMA extension from Azure Virtual Machine (VMs), Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure Arc Servers from a tenant.  
The utility works in two steps  
1. Discovery â€“ First the utility creates an inventory of all machines that have the MMA agents installed. We recommend that no new VMs, Virtual Machine Scale Sets or Azure Arc Servers with MMA extension are created while the utility is running.  
2. Removal - Second the utility selects machines with both MMA and AMA and removes the MMA extension. You can disable this step and run after validating the list of machines. There's an option remove from machines that only have the MMA agent, but we recommended that you first migrate all dependencies to AMA and then remove MMA.  

## Prerequisites  
You do all the setup steps in a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PowerShell Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell). 
 - Windows 10+ or Windows Server 2019+
 - PowerShell 5.0 or higher. Check the version by running `$PSVersionTable` and checking the PS Version
 - PowerShell. The language must be set to mode `FullLanguage`. Check the mode by running `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode` in PowerShell. You can find more details [here](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_language_modes?source=recommendations) 
 - Bicep. The setup scripts us Bicep to automate the installation. Check the installation by running `bicep --version`. See [install in PowerShell](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#azure-powershell) 
 - A [User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI)](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) which has 'Reader', Virtual Machine Contributor' and 'Azure Arc ScVmm VM Contributor' access on target scopes configured. 
 - A new Resource Group to contain all the Azure resources created automatically by the set up automation.
 - For granting remediation user-assigned MI with above mentioned roles on the target scopes, 
 - You must have User Access Administrator (UAA) or Owner on the configured scopes. For example, the set up is being configured for a subscription 'x', you must UAA role assignment on subscription 'x' so the script can provide the remediated user-assigned MI permissions.


## Download Deployment package
 The package contains:
- Bicep templates, which contain resource configuration details that you create as part of setup. 
- Deployment set up scripts, which provides the cmdlet to run installation. 
- Download deployment package zip from [here](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/raw/main/TemplateFiles/AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDeploymentFiles.zip) to your local machine. 
- Extract zip to local folder location.
- Unblock the files with this script.

  ``` PowerShell
  Get-ChildItem -Path "<Extracted folder path>" -Recurse | Unblock-File 
  ```

## Set up the tool
