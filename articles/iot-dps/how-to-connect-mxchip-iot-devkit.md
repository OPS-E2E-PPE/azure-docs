# Connect MXChip IoT DevKit to Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

This article describes how to configure DevKit in order to make it automatically register to IoT Hub using the Device Provisioning Service. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Configure global endpoint of DPS on device
* Use Unique Device Secret (UDS) to generate X.509 certificate
* Enroll individual device
* Verify the device is registered

## Before you begin

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you need the following:

* Prepare your DevKit with [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-get-started).
* Upgrade to latest firmware (>= 1.3.0) with [Firmware Upgrading](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/firmware-upgrading/) tutorial.
* Create and link IoT Hub with Device Provisioning Service instance with [Set up auto provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision).

## Set up the Device Provisioning Service configuration on the device

To enable the DevKit to connect to the Device Provisioning Service instance you created:

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** of your Device Provisioning Service and note down the **Global device endpoint** and **ID Scope** value.
  ![DPS Global Endpoint and ID Scope](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/dps-global-endpoint.png)

2. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) to have the latest version installed.

3. Open a command prompt. Clone the GitHub repo for DPS sample code:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DevKitExamples/DevKitDPS.git
  ```

4. Launch VS Code and connect DevKit to computer, open the folder that contains the code you cloned.

5. Open **DevKitDPS.ino**, Find, and replace `[Global Device Endpoint]` and `[ID Scope]` with the values you just note down.
  ![DPS Endpoint](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/endpoint.png)
  You can leave the **registrationId** as blank, the application generates one for you based on the MAC address and firmware version. If you want to customize it, the Registration ID has to use alphanumeric, lowercase, and hyphen combinations only with maximum 128 characters long. For more information, see [Manage device enrollments with Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/how-to-manage-enrollments).

6. Use **Quick Open** in VS Code (Windows: `Ctrl+P`, macOS: `Cmd+P`) and type **task device-upload** to build and upload the code to the DevKit.

7. Observe the success of the task in the output window.

## Save Unique Device Secret on STSAFE security chip

Device Provisioning Service can be configured on device based on its [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-iot-supports-new-security-hardware-to-strengthen-iot-security/). DevKit uses [Device Identity Composition Engine (DICE)](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/Foundational-Trust-for-IOT-and-Resource-Constrained-Devices.pdf) from the [Trusted Computing Group (TCG)](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org). A **Unique Device Secret (UDS)** saved in STSAFE security chip on the DevKit is used to generate the device unique [X.509](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/tutorial-set-up-device#select-a-hardware-security-module) certificate. The certificate can be later used for the enrollment process in the Device Provisioning Service.

A typical **Unique Device Secret (UDS)** is a 64 characters long string. A sample UDS is as below:

```
19e25a259d0c2be03a02d416c05c48ccd0cc7d1743458aae1cb488b074993eae
```

Each of two characters is used as Hex value in the security calculation. So the above sample UDS is resolved to: "`0x19`, `0xe2`, `0x5a`, `0x25`, `0x9d`, `0x0c`, `0x2b`, `0xe0`, `0x3a`, `0x02`, `0xd4`, `0x16`, `0xc0`, `0x5c`, `0x48`, `0xcc`, `0xd0`, `0xcc`, `0x7d`, `0x17`, `0x43`, `0x45`, `0x8a`, `0xae`, `0x1c`, `0xb4`, `0x88`, `0xb0`, `0x74`, `0x99`, `0x3e`, `0xae`".

To save Unique Device Secret on the DevKit:

1. Open serial monitor by using tool like Putty, see [Use Configuration Mode](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/use-configuration-mode/) for details.

2. With the DevKit connected to computer, hold down button A, then push and release the reset button to enter configuration mode. The screen should show the DevKit ID and **'Configuration'**.

3. Take the long sample UDS string above and change one or many characters to other values between `0` and `f`. This is used as your own UDS.

4. In serial monitor window, type **set_dps_uds [your_own_uds_value]** and press the Enter key to save it.
  > [!NOTE]
  > For example, if you set your own UDS by changing the last two characters to `f`, you need to enter the command like **set_dps_uds 19e25a259d0c2be03a02d416c05c48ccd0cc7d1743458aae1cb488b074993eff**.

5. Without closing the serial monitor window, press reset button on the DevKit.

6. Note down **DevKit MAC Address** and **DevKit Firmware Version** value.
  ![Firmware version](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/firmware-version.png)

## Generate X.509 certificate

### Windows

1. Open file explorer and go to the folder contain the DSP sample code you cloned, there is a **.build** folder, find, and copy **DPS.ino.bin** and **DPS.ino.map** in it.
  ![Generated files](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/generated-files.png)
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you have changed the `built.path` configuration for Arduino to other folder. You need to find those files in the folder you configured.

2. Paste these two files into **tools** folder on the same level with **.build** folder.

3. Run **dps_cert_gen.exe**, follow the prompts to enter your **UDS**, **MAC address** for the DevKit and the **firmware version** to generate the X.509 certificate.
  ![Run dps-cert-gen.exe](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/dps-cert-gen.png)

4. Observe the success of generation, a **.pem** certificate is saved in the same folder.

## Create a device enrollment entry in the Device Provisioning Service

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your provisioning service. Click **Manage enrollments**, and select the **Individual Enrollments** tab.
  ![Individual enrollments](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/individual-enrollments.png)

2. Click **Add**.

3. In **Mechanism**, choose **X.509**.
  ![Upload cert](./media/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit/upload-cert.png)

4. In **Certificate .pem or .cer file**, upload the **.pem** certificate you just have.

5. Leave the rest as default and click **Save**.

## Start the DevKit

1. Launch VS Code and open serial monitor.

2. Press the **Reset** button on your DevKit.

You should see the DevKit start the registration with your Device Provisioning Service.

## Verify the DevKit is registered on IoT Hub

Once your device boots, the following actions should take place:

1. The device sends a registration request to your Device Provisioning Service.
2. The Device Provisioning Service sends back a registration challenge to which your device responds.
3. On successful registration, the Device Provisioning Service sends the IoT hub URI, device ID, and the encrypted key back to the device.
4. The IoT Hub client application on the device then connects to your hub.
5. On successful connection to the hub, you should see the device appear in the IoT hub's Device Explorer.

## Change device ID

The default device ID registered in Azure IoT Hub is **AZ3166**. If you want to modify it, follow [instructions here](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/customize-device-id/).
