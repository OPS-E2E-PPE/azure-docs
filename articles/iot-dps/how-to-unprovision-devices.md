# How to unprovision devices enrolled by your provisioning service

You may find it necessary to unprovision devices that have been provisioned through the Device Provisioning Service. For example, a device may be sold or moved to a different IoT hub, or it may be lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. 

In general, unprovisioning a device involves two steps:

1. Revoke access for the device to your provisioning service. Depending on whether you want to revoke access temporarily or permanently, or, in the case of the X.509 attestation mechanism, on the hierarchy of your existing enrollment groups, you may want to either disable or delete an enrollment entry. 
 
   - To learn how to revoke device access using the portal, see [Revoke device access](how-to-revoke-device-access-portal.md).
   - To learn how to revoke device access programmatically using one of the provisioning service SDKs, see [Manage device enrollments with service SDKs](how-to-manage-enrollments-sdks.md).

2. Disable or delete the device's entry in the identity registry for the IoT Hub where it was provisioned. To learn more, see [Manage device identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#disable-devices) in the Azure IoT Hub documentation. 

The exact steps you take to unprovision a device will depend on the attestation mechanism it uses.

Devices that use TPM attestation or X.509 attestation with a self-signed leaf certificate (no certificate chain) are provisioned through an individual enrollment entry. For these devices, you can delete the entry to permanently revoke the device's access to the provisioning service or disable the entry to temporarily revoke its access, and then follow-up by either deleting or disabling the device in the identity registry with the IoT hub that it was provisioned to.

With X.509 attestation, devices can also be provisioned through an enrollment group. Enrollment groups are configured with a signing certificate, either an intermediate or root CA certificate, and control access to the provisioning service for devices with that certificate in their certificate chain. To learn more about enrollment groups and X.509 certificates with the provisioning service, see [X.509 certificates](concepts-security.md#x509-certificates). 

To see a list of devices that have been provisioned through an enrollment group, you can view the enrollment group's details. This is an easy way to understand which IoT hub each device has been provisioned to. To view the device list: 

1. Log in to the Azure portal and click **All resources** on the left-hand menu.
2. Click your provisioning service in the list of resources.
3. In your provisioning service, click **Manage enrollments**, then select **Enrollment Groups** tab.
4. Click the enrollment group to open it.

With enrollment groups, there are two scenarios to consider:

- To unprovision all of the devices that have been provisioned through an enrollment group, you must first disable the enrollment group to blacklist its signing certificate. Then you can use the list of provisioned devices for that enrollment group to disable or delete each device from the identity registry of its respective IoT hub. After disabling or deleting all devices from their respective IoT hubs, you can optionally delete the enrollment group. Be aware, though, that, if you delete the enrollment group and there is an enabled enrollment group for a signing certificate higher up in the certificate chain of one or more of the devices, those devices can re-enroll. 
- To unprovision a single device from an enrollment group, you must first create a disabled individual enrollment for its leaf (device) certificate. This revokes access to the provisioning service for that device while still permitting access for other devices that have the enrollment group's signing certificate in their chain. Then you can use the list of provisioned devices in the enrollment group details to find the IoT hub that the device was provisioned to and disable or delete it from that hub's identity registry. Do not delete the disabled individual enrollment for the device. Doing so will allow the device to re-enroll through the enrollment group.
