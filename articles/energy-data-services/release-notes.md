### Enable Resource sharing (CORS)
CORS provides a secure way to allow one origin (the origin domain) to call APIs in another origin. With this feature you can set CORS rules for each Azure Data Manager for Energy instance. When you set CORS rules for the instance it gets applied automatically across all the services and storage accounts linked with Microsoft Energy Data services.[Learn more.]( ../energy-data-services/how-to-enable-CORS.md)

## January 2023

You can use a managed identity to authenticate to any [service that supports Azure AD (Active Directory) authentication](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-azure-active-directory-support.md) with Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview. For example, you can write a script in Azure Function to ingest data in Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview. Now, you can use managed identity to connect to Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview using system or user assigned managed identity from other Azure services. [Learn more.]( ../energy-data-services/how-to-use-managed-identity.md)

### Availability zone support

Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Availability Zones provide in-region High Availability and protection against local disasters. Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview supports zone-redundant instance by default and there's no setup required by the Customer.

## October 2022

### Support for Private Links

Azure Private Link on Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview provides private access to the service. This means traffic between your private network and Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview travels over the Microsoft backbone network therefore limiting any exposure over the internet. By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview instance from your virtual network via a private endpoint, which is a set of private IP addresses in a subnet within the virtual network. You can then limit access to your Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview instance over these private IP addresses. [Create a private endpoint for Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview](how-to-set-up-private-links.md).

### Encryption at Rest using Customer Managed Keys
Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview supports customer managed encryption keys (CMK). All data in Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys by default. In addition to Microsoft-managed key, you can use your own encryption key to protect the data in Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview. When you specify a customer-managed key, that key is used to protect and control access to the Microsoft-managed key that encrypts your data.

## September 2022

### Key Announcement: Preview Release

Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview is now available in public preview. Information on latest releases, bug fixes, & deprecated functionality for Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview will be updated monthly. Keep tracking this page. 

Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview is developed in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU™ Technical Standard, Version 1.0. and is currently aligned with Mercury Release(R3), [Milestone-12](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/governance/project-management-committee/-/wikis/M12-Release-Notes).

### Partition & User Management

- New data partitions can be [created dynamically](how-to-add-more-data-partitions.md) as needed post provisioning of the platform (up to five). Earlier, data partitions could only be created when provisioning a new instance.
- The domain name for entitlement groups for [user management](how-to-manage-users.md) has been changed to "dataservices.energy".

### Data Ingestion

- Enabled support for user context in ingestion ([ADR: Issue 52](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/data-flow/ingestion/home/-/issues/52)) 
  - User identity is preserved and passed on to all ingestion workflow related services using the newly introduced _x-on-behalf-of_ header. A user needs to have appropriate service level entitlements on all dependent services involved in the ingestion workflow and only users with appropriate data level entitlements can modify data.
- Workflow service payload is restricted to a maximum of 2 MB. If it exceeds, the service will throw an HTTP 413 error. This restriction is placed to prevent workflow requests from overwhelming the server.
- Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview uses Azure Data Factory (ADF) to run large scale ingestion workloads.

### Search

- Improved security as Elasticsearch images are now pulled from Microsoft's internal Azure Container Registry instead of public repositories.
- Improved security by enabling encryption in transit for Elasticsearch, Registration, and Notification services.

### Monitoring

- Diagnostic settings can be exported from [Airflow](how-to-integrate-airflow-logs-with-azure-monitor.md) and [Elasticsearch](how-to-integrate-elastic-logs-with-azure-monitor.md) to Azure Monitor.

### Region Availability

- Currently, Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview is being offered in the following regions - South Central US, East US, West Europe, and North Europe.
