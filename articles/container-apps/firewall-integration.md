# Securing a custom VNET in Azure Container Apps

Firewall settings Network Security Groups (NSGs) needed to configure virtual networks closely resemble the settings required by Kubernetes.

Some outbound dependencies of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters rely exclusively on fully qualified domain names (FQDN), therefore securing an AKS cluster purely with NSGs isn't possible. Refer to [Control egress traffic for cluster nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic) for details.

* You can lock down a network via NSGs with more restrictive rules than the default NSG rules.
* To fully secure a cluster, use a combination of NSGs and a firewall.

## NSG allow rules

The following tables describe how to configure a collection of NSG allow rules.

### Inbound

| Protocol | Port | ServiceTag | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| Any | \* | Control plane subnet address space | Allow communication between IPs in the control plane subnet. This address is passed to as a parameter when you create an environment. For example, `10.0.0.0/21`. |
| Any | \* | App subnet address space | Allow communication between nodes in the app subnet. This address is passed as a parameter when you create an environment. For example, `10.0.8.0/21`. |

### Outbound with ServiceTags

| Protocol | Port | ServiceTag | Description
|--|--|--|--|
| UDP | `1194` | `AzureCloud.<REGION>` | Required for internal AKS secure connection between underlying nodes and control plane. Replace `<REGION>` with the region where your container app is deployed. |
| TCP | `9000` | `AzureCloud.<REGION>` | Required for internal AKS secure connection between underlying nodes and control plane. Replace `<REGION>` with the region where your container app is deployed. |
| TCP | `443` | `AzureMonitor` | Allows outbound calls to Azure Monitor. |

### Outbound with wild card IP rules

As the following rules require allowing all IPs, use a Firewall solution to lock down to specific FQDNs.

| Protocol | Port | IP | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| TCP | `443` | \* | Allow all outbound on port `443` provides a way to allow all FQDN based outbound dependencies that don't have a static IP. |
| UDP | `123` | \* | NTP server. If using firewall, allowlist `ntp.ubuntu.com:123`. |
| Any | \* | Control plane subnet address space | Allow communication between IPs in the control plane subnet. This address is passed as a parameter when you create an environment. For example, `10.0.0.0/21`. |
| Any | \* | App subnet address space | Allow communication between nodes in the App subnet. This address is passed as a parameter when you create an environment. For example, `10.0.8.0/21`. |

## Firewall configuration

### Outbound FQDN dependencies

| FQDN | Protocol | Port | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| `*.hcp.<REGION>.azmk8s.io` | HTTPS | `443` | Required for internal AKS secure connection between nodes and control plane. |
| `mcr.microsoft.com` | HTTPS | `443` | Required to access images in Microsoft Container Registry (MCR). This registry contains first-party images and charts (for example, coreDNS). These images are required for the correct creation and functioning of the cluster, including scale and upgrade operations. |
| `*.data.mcr.microsoft.com` | HTTPS | `443` | Required for MCR storage backed by the Azure content delivery network (CDN). |
| `management.azure.com` | HTTPS | `443` | Required for Kubernetes operations against the Azure API. |
| `login.microsoftonline.com` | HTTPS | `443` | Required for Azure Active Directory authentication. |
| `packages.microsoft.com` | HTTPS | `443` | This address is the Microsoft packages repository used for cached apt-get operations. Example packages include Moby, PowerShell, and Azure CLI. |
| `acs-mirror.azureedge.net` | HTTPS | `443` | This address is for the repository required to download and install required binaries like `kubenet` and Azure Container Networking Interface. |
| `dc.services.visualstudio.com` | HTTPS | `443` | This endpoint is used for metrics and monitoring using Azure Monitor. |
| `*.ods.opinsights.azure.com` | HTTPS | `443` | This endpoint is used by Azure Monitor for ingesting log analytics data. |
| `*.oms.opinsights.azure.com` | HTTPS | `443` | This endpoint is used by `omsagent`, which is used to authenticate the log analytics service. |
| `*.monitoring.azure.com` | HTTPS | `443` | This endpoint is used to send metrics data to Azure Monitor. |
