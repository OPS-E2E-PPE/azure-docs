# The collection of PaaS/SaaS technologies and solutions available for building an Azure IoT solution

Microsoft has built a portfolio that supports the needs of all customers, enabling everyone to access the benefits of digital transformation. The Azure IoT product portfolio is an overview of the available PaaS/SaaS technologies and solutions. It presents the two paths that are available for building your own solution:
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): build your application using Azure IoT Suite, a collection of enterprise-grade preconfigured solutions that enable you to accelerate the development of custom IoT solutions.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): get started fast with the new SaaS solution to develop IoT applications without being exposed to the complexity of IoT solution. If your organization lacks the resources to build your own IoT solution, Azure IoT Central is a codeless IoT solution that can create device models, dashboards, and rules in minutes.

## Solutions

Get started quickly with Azure IoT Suite and SaaS offerings. Choose from preconfigured solutions that enable common IoT scenarios, such as remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and connected factory, to create a fully customizable solution. Or use Azure IoT Central, a fully managed, end-to-end solution that enables powerful IoT scenarios without requiring cloud-solution expertise.

### Azure IoT Suite (PaaS)

Azure IoT Suite is an enterprise-grade collection of customizable PaaS solutions that provide a high level of control over your IoT solution. If your business is implementing IoT for connected operations or has specific customization requirements for connected products, Azure IoT Suite provides the control you need. 

Organizations with a large number of devices or device models, and manufacturers seeking connected factory solutions, are examples of companies that can benefit from Azure IoT Suite. Creating highly customizable solutions tailored to complex needs, IoT Suite provides:

- Preconfigured solutions
    - Remote monitoring
    - Connected factory
    - Predictive maintenance
    - Device simulation
- Ability to deploy in minutes
- Accelerated time to value
- Solutions that give ultimate control 
 
### Azure IoT Central (SaaS)

Azure IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS solution, which allows you to get started quickly with minimal IoT experience. If your business is pursuing speed over customization, SaaS models could be the perfect fit for your IoT implementation needs. 

Organizations with fewer device models, more predictable scenarios, and limited IoT/IT capabilities can now reap the benefits of IoT through a SaaS approach. Businesses that previously lacked the time, money, and expertise to develop connected products, can now get started quickly with Azure IoT Central. Microsoft is leading the industry in providing a mature SaaS solution that addresses common IoT implementation requirements. 

- Fully managed IoT SaaS
- No cloud solution development expertise required
- Configurable to your needs
- Ideal for straightforward IoT needs

## Technologies (PaaS)

With the most comprehensive IoT portfolio of platform services, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies that span the Azure platform enable you to easily create, customize, and control all aspects of your IoT solution. Establish bi-directional communications with billions of IoT devices and manage your IoT devices at scale. Then integrate your IoT device data with other platform services, such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Time Series Insights, to enhance insights across your solution. 

### Device support

Get started on your IoT project with confidence by leveraging [Azure IoT Starter Kits](https://catalog.azureiotsuite.com/kits) or choosing from hundreds of Certified for IoT devices in the [device catalog](http://catalog.azureiotsuite.com/). All devices are platform-agnostic and tested to connect seamlessly to IoT Hub.
Connect all your devices to Azure IoT using the open-source [device SDKs](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks). The SDKs support multiple operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and real-time operating systems, as well as multiple programming languages, such as [C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c), [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node), [Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java), [.NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp), and [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python).

### IoT 
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bidirectional communications between millions of IoT devices and a solution back end. The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention, enabling customers to provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

### Edge
Azure IoT Edge is an Internet of Things (IoT) service. This service is meant for customers who want to analyze data on devices, a.k.a. "at the edge." By moving parts of your workload to the edge, you will experience reduced latency and have the option for off-line scenarios.


### Data and analytics
Take advantage of an array of Azure data and analytics PaaS offerings in your IoT solution, from bringing cloud intelligence to the edge with Azure Machine Learning, to storing IoT device data in a cost-effective way with Azure Data Lake, to visualizing huge amount of data from IoT devices with Azure Time Series Insights.

### Visualization and integration
Microsoft Azure offers a complete cloud solution, one that combines a constantly growing collection of integrated cloud services with an industry-leading commitment to the protection and privacy of your data. Find out more about [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).
