# What is the right IoT solution for your business?

To build an IoT solution for your business, you typically evaluate your solution by using the *managed app platform* approach and build your enterprise solution by using the *platform services*.

Platform services provide all the building blocks for customized and flexible IoT applications. You have more options to choose and code when you connect devices, and ingest, store, and analyze your data. Azure IoT platform services include the products Azure IoT Hub and Azure Digital Twins.

A managed app platform lets you quickly evaluate your IoT solution by reducing the number of decisions needed to achieve results. The managed app platform takes care of most infrastructure elements in your solution, so you can focus on adding industry knowledge, and evaluating the solution. Azure IoT Central is a managed app platform.

## Management

The platform services give you full control over the underlying services in your solution. For example:

- Scaling and securing services to meet your needs.
- Using in-house or partner expertise to onboard devices and provision services.

A managed app platform lets you take advantage of a platform that handles the security and management of your IoT applications and devices.

## Control

Platform services let you fully customize and control the solution architecture.

A managed app platform lets you customize branding, dashboards, user roles, devices, and telemetry. However, you don't handle the underlying IoT system management.

## Pricing

Platform services let you fine-tune services and control overall costs.

A managed app platform gives you a simple, predictable pricing structure.

## Summary

Platform services approach let you:

- Fine-tune the services in the solution.
- Have a high degree of control over the services in the solution.
- Fully customize the solution.

A managed app platform is useful when you're evaluating an IoT solution and:

- Don't want to dedicate extensive resources to system design, development, and management.
- Do want a predictable pricing structure.
- Do want some customization capabilities.
