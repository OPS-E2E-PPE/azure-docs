# Register existing SAP system (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview content notice](./includes/preview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [RBAC preview content notice](./includes/preview-rbac.md)]

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to register an existing SAP system with *Azure Center for SAP solutions*. After you register an SAP system with Azure Center for SAP solutions, you can use its visualization, management and monitoring capabilities through the Azure portal. For example, you can:

- View and track the SAP system as an Azure resource, called the *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS)*.
- Get recommendations for your SAP infrastructure, based on quality checks that evaluate best practices for SAP on Azure.
- Get health and status information about your SAP system.
- Start and Stop SAP application tier.
- Monitor the Azure infrastructure metrics for the SAP system resources.

## Prerequisites

- Check that you're trying to register a [supported SAP system configuration](#supported-systems)
- Check that your Azure account has **Contributor** role access on the subscription or resource groups where you have the SAP system resources.
- Register the **Microsoft.Workloads** Resource Provider in the subscription where you have the SAP system.
- A **User-assigned managed identity** which has **Virtual Machine Contributor** and **Tag Contributor** role access on the Compute resource group and **Reader** and **Tag Contributor** role access on the Network resource group of the SAP system. Azure Center for SAP solutions service uses this identity to discover your SAP system resources and register the system as a VIS resource.
- Make sure each virtual machine (VM) in the SAP system is currently running on Azure. These VMs include:
    - The ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) Server instance
    - The Application Server instance or instances
    - The Database instance for the SAP system identifier (SID)
- Make sure the **sapstartsrv** process is currently running on all the VMs in the SAP system.
    - Command to start up sapstartsrv process on SAP VMs: /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/hostexecstart -start
- Grant access to your Azure Storage accounts from the virtual network where the SAP system exists. Use one of these options:
    - Allow outbound internet connectivity for the VMs.
    - Use a [**Storage** service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md) to allow connectivity to any Azure storage account from the VMs.
    - Use a [**Storage** service tag with regional scope](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md) to allow storage account connectivity to the Azure storage accounts in the same region as the VMs.
    - Allowlist the region-specific IP addresses for Azure Storage.

## Supported systems

You can register SAP systems with Azure Center for SAP solutions that run on the following configurations:

- SAP NetWeaver or ABAP stacks
- Windows, SUSE and RHEL Linux operating systems
- HANA, DB2, SQL Server, Oracle, Max DB, and SAP ASE databases

The following SAP system configurations aren't supported in Azure Center for SAP solutions:

- HANA Large Instance (HLI)
- Systems with HANA Scale-out configuration
- Java stack
- Dual stack (ABAP and Java)
- Systems distributed across peered virtual networks
- Systems using IPv6 addresses
- SAP system with multiple Application Server Instances on a single Virtual Machine
- SAP system with [clustered Application Server architecture](../virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-rhel-with-dialog-instance.md)
- Multiple SIDs running on same set of Virtual Machines. For example, two or more SIDs sharing a single VM for ASCS instance. 

## Enable resource permissions

When you register an existing SAP system as a VIS, Azure Center for SAP solutions service needs a **User-assigned managed identity** which has **Virtual Machine Contributor** and **Tag Contributor** role access on the Compute (VMs, Disks, Load balancers) resource group and **Reader** role access on the Virtual Network resource group of the SAP system. Before you register an SAP system with Azure Center for SAP solutions, either [create a new user-assigned managed identity or update role access for an existing managed identity](#setup-user-assigned-managed-identity).

Azure Center for SAP solutions uses this user-assigned managed identity to install VM extensions on the ASCS, Application Server and DB VMs. This step allows Azure Center for SAP solutions to discover the SAP system components, and other SAP system metadata. User-assigned managed identity is required to enable SAP system monitoring and management capabilities.

### Setup User-assigned managed identity

To provide permissions to the SAP system resources to a user-assigned managed identity:

1. [Create a new user-assigned managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity) if needed or use an existing one.
1. [Assign **Virtual Machine Contributor** and **Tag Contributor**](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities.md#manage-access-to-user-assigned-managed-identities) role access to the user-assigned managed identity on the resource group(s) which have the Virtual Machines, Disks and Load Balancers of the SAP system and **Reader** role on the resource group(s) which have the Virtual Network components of the SAP system.
1. Once the permissions are assigned, this managed identity can be used in Azure Center for SAP solutions to register and manage SAP systems.

> [!NOTE]
> User-assigned managed identity requires **Tag Contributor** role on VMs, Disks and Load Balancers of the SAP system to enable [Cost Analysis](view-cost-analysis.md) at SAP SID level.

## Register SAP system

To register an existing SAP system in Azure Center for SAP solutions:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Make sure to sign in with an Azure account that has **Contributor** role access to the subscription or resource groups where the SAP system exists. For more information, see the [resource permissions explanation](#enable-resource-permissions).
1. Search for and select **Azure Center for SAP solutions** in the Azure portal's search bar.
1. On the **Azure Center for SAP solutions** page, select **Register an existing SAP system**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Register existing SAP system** page, provide information about the SAP system.
    1. For **ASCS virtual machine**, select **Select ASCS virtual machine** and select the ASCS VM resource.
    1. For **SID name**, enter the SID name.
    1. For **SAP product**, select the SAP system product from the drop-down menu.
    1. For **Environment**, select the environment type from the drop-down menu. For example, production or non-production environments.
    1. For **Managed identity source**, select **Use existing user-assigned managed identity** option.
    1. For **Managed identity name**, select a **User-assigned managed identity** which has **Virtual Machine Contributor**, **Reader** and **Tag Contributor** role access to the [respective resources of this SAP system.](#enable-resource-permissions)
    1. Select **Review + register** to discover the SAP system and begin the registration process.

    1. On the **Review + register** pane, make sure your settings are correct. Then, select **Register**.

1. Wait for the VIS resource to be created. The VIS name is the same as the SID name. The VIS deployment finishes after all SAP system components are discovered from the ASCS VM that you selected.
  
You can now review the VIS resource in the Azure portal. The resource page shows the SAP system resources, and information about the system.

If the registration doesn't succeed, see [what to do when an SAP system registration fails in Azure Center for SAP solutions](#fix-registration-failure).

## Fix registration failure

The process of registering an SAP system in Azure Center for SAP solutions might fail for the following reasons:

- The selected ASCS VM and SID don't match. Make sure to select the correct ASCS VM for the SAP system that you chose, and vice versa.
- The ASCS instance or VM isn't running. Make sure the instance and VM are in the **Running** state.
- The **sapstartsrv** process isn't running on all the VMs in the SAP system.
    - Command to start up sapstartsrv process on SAP VMs: /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/hostexecstart -start
- At least one Application Server and the Database aren't running for the SAP system that you chose. Make sure the Application Servers and Database VMs are in the **Running** state.
- The user trying to register the SAP system doesn't have **Contributor** role permissions. For more information, see the [prerequisites for registering an SAP system](#prerequisites).
- The user-assigned managed identity doesn't have **Virtual Machine Contributor** role access to the Compute resources and **Reader** role access to the Network resource groups of the SAP system. For more information, see [how to enable Azure Center for SAP solutions resource permissions](#enable-resource-permissions).

### Error - Failed to discover details from the DB VM
This error happens when the Database identifier is incorrectly configured on the SAP system. One possible cause is that the Application Server profile parameter `rsdb/dbid` has an incorrect identifier for the HANA Database. To fix the error:

1. Stop the Application Server instance:
    
    `sapcontrol -nr -function Stop`

1. Stop the ASCS instance:

    `sapcontrol -nr -function Stop`

1. Open the Application Server profile.

1. Add the profile parameter for the HANA Database: 

    `rsdb/dbid = HanaDbSid`

1. Restart the Application Server instance: 

    `sapcontrol -nr -function Start`

1. Restart the ASCS instance: 

    `sapcontrol -nr -function Start`

1. Delete the VIS resource whose registration failed.

1. [Register the SAP system](#register-sap-system) again.

### Error - Azure VM Agent not in desired provisioning state
This issue occurs when Azure VM agent's provisioning state is not as expected on the specified Virtual Machine. Expected state is **Ready**. Verify the agent status by checking the properties section in the VM overview page. To fix the VM Agent, 
1. Login to the VM using bastion or serial console.
1. If the VM agent exists and is not running, then restart the waagent.
  - sudo systemctl status waagent. 
  - If the service is not running then restart this service. To restart use the following steps:
  - sudo systemctl stop waagent
  - sudo systemctl start waagent
  - If this does not solve the issue, try updating the VM Agent using [this document](../virtual-machines/extensions/update-linux-agent.md)
3. If the VM agent does not exist or needs to be re-installed, then follow [this documentation](../virtual-machines/extensions/update-linux-agent.md).

If your registration fails:

1. Review the previous list of possible reasons for failure. Follow any steps to fix the issue.
1. Review any error messages in the Azure portal. Follow any recommended actions.
1. Delete the VIS resource from the failed registration. The VIS has the same name as the SID that you tried to register.
1. Retry the [registration process](#register-sap-system) again.
