# Mount a gitRepo volume in Azure Container Instances

Learn how to mount a *gitRepo* volume to clone a Git repository into your container instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Mounting a *gitRepo* volume is currently restricted to Linux containers. While we are working to bring all features to Windows containers, you can find current platform differences in [Quotas and region availability for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).

## gitRepo volume

The *gitRepo* volume mounts a directory and clones the specified Git repository into it at container startup. By using a *gitRepo* volume in your container instances, you can avoid adding the code for doing so in your applications.

When you mount a *gitRepo* volume, you can set three properties to configure the volume:

| Property | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `repository` | Yes | The full URL, including `http://` or `https://`, of the Git repository to be cloned.|
| `directory` | No | Directory into which the repository should be cloned. The path must not contain or start with "`..`".  If you specify "`.`", the repository is cloned into the volume's directory. Otherwise, the Git repository is cloned into a subdirectory of the given name within the volume directory. |
| `revision` | No | The commit hash of the revision to be cloned. If unspecified, the `HEAD` revision is cloned. |

## Mount a gitRepo volume

To mount a *gitRepo* volume in a container instance, you must deploy using an [Azure Resource Manager template](/azure/templates/microsoft.containerinstance/containergroups).

First, populate the `volumes` array in the container group `properties` section of the template. Next, for each container in the container group in which you'd like to mount the *gitRepo* volume, populate the `volumeMounts` array in the `properties` section of the container definition.

For example, the following Resource Manager template creates a container group consisting of a single container. The container clones two GitHub repositories specified by the *gitRepo* volume blocks. The second volume includes additional properties specifying a directory to clone to, and the commit hash of a specific revision to clone.

[!code-json[volume-gitrepo](~/azure-docs-json-samples/container-instances/aci-deploy-volume-gitrepo.json)]

The resulting directory structure of the two cloned repos defined in the preceding template is:

```
/mnt/repo1/aci-helloworld
/mnt/repo2/my-custom-clone-directory
```

To see an example of container instance deployment with an Azure Resource Manager template, see [Deploy multi-container groups in Azure Container Instances](container-instances-multi-container-group.md).
