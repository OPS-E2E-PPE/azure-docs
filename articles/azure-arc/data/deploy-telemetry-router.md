# Deploy the Azure Arc telemetry Router

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The telemetry router is in Public Preview and should be deployed for **testing purposes only**.
> - While the telemetry router is in Public Preview, be advised that future preview releases could include changes to CRD specs, CLI commands, and/or telemetry router messages.
> - The current preview does not support in-place upgrades of a data controller deployed with the Arc telemetry router enabled. In order to install or upgrade a data controller in a future release, you will need to uninstall the data controller and then re-install.

## What is the Azure Arc Telemetry Router?

The Azure Arc telemetry router enables exporting telemetry data to other monitoring solutions. For this Public Preview, we only support exporting log data to either Kafka or Elasticsearch and metric data to Kafka.

This document specifies how to deploy the telemetry router and configure it to work with the supported exporters.

## Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The telemetry router currently supports indirectly connected mode only.

### Create a Custom Configuration Profile

After setting up your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to [create a custom configuration profile](create-custom-configuration-template.md). Next, enable a temporary feature flag that deploys the telemetry router during data controller creation.

### Turn on the Feature Flag

After creating the custom configuration profile, you'll need to edit the profile to add the `monitoring` property with the `enableOpenTelemetry` flag set to `true`. You can set the feature flag by running the following az CLI commands (edit the --path parameter, as necessary):

```bash
az arcdata dc config add --path ./control.json --json-values ".spec.monitoring={}"
az arcdata dc config add --path ./control.json --json-values ".spec.monitoring.enableOpenTelemetry=true"
```

To confirm the flag was set correctly, open the control.json file and confirm the `monitoring` object was added to the `spec` object and `enableOpenTelemetry` is set to `true`.

```yaml
spec:
    monitoring:
        enableOpenTelemetry: true
```

This feature flag requirement will be removed in a future release.

### Create the Data Controller

After creating the custom configuration profile and setting the feature flag, you're ready to [create the data controller using indirect connectivity mode](create-data-controller-indirect-cli.md?tabs=linux). Be sure to replace the `--profile-name` parameter with a `--path` parameter that points to your custom control.json file (see [use custom control.json file to deploy Azure Arc-enabled data controller](create-custom-configuration-template.md))

### Verify Telemetry Router Deployment

When the data controller is created, a TelemetryRouter custom resource is also created. Data controller deployment is marked ready when both custom resources have finished deploying. After the data controller finishes deployment, you can use the following command to verify that the TelemetryRouter exists:

```bash
kubectl describe telemetryrouter arc-telemetry-router -n <namespace>
```

```yaml
apiVersion: arcdata.microsoft.com/v1beta4
  kind: TelemetryRouter
  metadata:
    name: arc-telemetry-router
    namespace: <namespace>
  spec:
    credentials:
      certificates:
      - certificateName: arcdata-msft-elasticsearch-exporter-internal
      - certificateName: cluster-ca-certificate
    exporters:
      elasticsearch:
      - caCertificateName: cluster-ca-certificate
        certificateName: arcdata-msft-elasticsearch-exporter-internal
        endpoint: https://logsdb-svc:9200
        index: logstash-otel
        name: arcdata/msft/internal
    pipelines:
      logs:
        exporters:
        - elasticsearch/arcdata/msft/internal

```

For the public preview, the pipeline and exporter have a default pre-configuration to Microsoft's deployment of Elasticsearch. This default deployment gives you an example of how the parameters for credentials, exporters, and pipelines are set up within the spec. You can follow this example to export to your own monitoring solutions. See [adding exporters and pipelines](adding-exporters-and-pipelines.md) for more examples. This example deployment will be removed at the conclusion of the public preview.

After the TelemetryRouter is deployed, both TelemetryCollector custom resources should be in a *Ready* state. These resources are system managed and editing them isn't supported. If you look at the pods, you should see the following types of pods:

- Two telemetry collector pods - `arctc-collector-inbound-0` and `arctc-collector-outbound-0`
- A kakfa broker pod - `arck-arc-router-kafka-broker-0`
- A kakfa controller pod - `arck-arc-router-kafka-controller-0`

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
