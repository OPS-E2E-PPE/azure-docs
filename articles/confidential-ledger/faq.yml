  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I tell if the Azure confidential ledger service would be useful to my organization?
        answer: |
          Azure confidential ledger is ideal for organizations with records valuable enough for a motivated attacker to try to compromise the underlying logging/storage system, including "insider" scenarios where a rogue employee might attempt to forge, modify, or remove previous records.
          
      - question: |
          What makes Azure confidential ledger much more secure?
        answer: |
          As its name suggests, the ledger utilizes [Azure Confidential Computing platform](../confidential-computing/index.yml) and the [Confidential Consortium Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/confidential-consortium-framework) to provide a high integrity solution that is tamper protected and evident. One ledger spans across three or more identical instances, each of which run in a dedicated, fully attested hardware-backed enclave. The ledger's integrity is maintained through a consensus-based blockchain.
          
      - question: |
          When writing to the Azure confidential ledger, do I need to store write receipts?
        answer: |
          Not necessarily. Some solutions today require users to maintain write receipts for future log validation. This requires users to manage those receipts in a secure storage facility, which adds an extra burden. The ledger eliminates this challenge through a Merkle tree-based approach, where write receipts include a full tree path to a signed root-of-trust. Users can verify transactions without storing or managing any ledger data.
          
      - question: |
          How do I verify ledger's authenticity?
        answer: |
          You can verify that the ledger server nodes that your client is communicating with are authentic. For details, see [Authenticating confidential ledger Nodes](authenticate-ledger-nodes.md).
    
  - name: User management
    questions:

      - question: |
          How can I manage users on a ledger?
        answer: |
          You can manage users on a ledger through the portal or one of the available SDKs: [python](https://pypi.org/project/azure-confidentialledger/), [.NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/security.confidentialledger-readme-pre), or [Java (preview)](/java/api/overview/azure/data-confidentialledger-readme?view=azure-java-preview).

      - question: |
          Can Microsoft help me manage users on a ledger I have created?
        answer: |
          No. Once a ledger is created, Microsoft has no access to user management. 

      - question: |
          I've created a ledger without an administrator. Can I still add users?
        answer: |
          If you create a ledger without an administrator, the AAD/cert gets admin rights. That identity can be used to manage the ledger.
