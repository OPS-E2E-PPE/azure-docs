# How to share an Azure Managed Grafana Preview workspace

A DevOps team may build dashboards to monitor and diagnose an application or infrastructure that it manages. Likewise, a support team may use a Grafana monitoring solution for troubleshooting customer issues. In these scenarios, multiple users will be accessing one Grafana workspace. Azure Managed Grafana enables such sharing by allowing you to set the custom permissions on a workspace that you own. This article explains what permissions are supported and how to grant permissions to share dashboards with your internal teams or external customers.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet).
- An Azure Managed Grafana workspace. If you don't have one yet, [create a workspace](/azure/managed-grafana/how-to-permissions).

## Supported Grafana roles

Azure Managed Grafana supports the Admin, Viewer and Editor roles:

- The Admin role provides full control of the workspace including viewing, editing, and configuring data sources.
- The Editor role provides read-write access to the dashboards in the workspace
- The Viewer role provides read-only access to dashboards in the workspace.

The Admin role is automatically assigned to the creator of a Grafana workspace. More details on Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles can be found at [Grafana organization roles](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/permissions/organization_roles/#compare-roles).

Grafana user roles and assignments are fully integrated with the Azure Active Directory. You can manage these permissions from the Azure portal or the command line. This section explains how to assign users to the Viewer or Editor role in the Azure portal.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

## Assign an Admin, Viewer or Editor role to a user
