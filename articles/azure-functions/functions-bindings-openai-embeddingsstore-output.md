<!--- Question: It seems like this binding uses Azure AI Search and not Azure OpenAI. Do we need to rename the article to:
"Azure AI Search semantic output binding" or something like that?-->
# Azure OpenAI embeddings store output binding for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI embeddings store output binding allows you to write files to a semantic document store that can be referenced later in a semantic search.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about semantic ranking in Azure AI Search, see [Semantic ranking in Azure AI Search](../search/semantic-search-overview.md).

## Attributes

Apply the `EmbeddingsStoreOutput` attribute to define an embeddings store output binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **ConnectionName** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **Collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **Query** |  Gets or sets the semantic query text to use for searching. This property is only used for the semantic search input binding. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **EmbeddingsModel** | Gets or sets the ID of the model to use for embeddings. The default value is `text-embedding-3-small`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **ChatModel** | Gets or sets the name of the Large Language Model to invoke for chat responses. The default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **SystemPrompt** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the system prompt to use for prompting the large language model. The system prompt is appended with knowledge that is fetched as a result of the `Query`. The combined prompt is then sent to the OpenAI Chat API. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **MaxKnowledgeCount** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the number of knowledge items to inject into the `SystemPrompt`.|

## Annotations

The `EmbeddingsStoreOutput` annotation enables you to define a embeddings store output binding, which supports these parameters: 

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **name** | Gets or sets the name of the output binding. |
| **connectionName** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **query** |  Gets or sets the semantic query text to use for searching. This property is only used for the semantic search input binding. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **embeddingsModel** | Gets or sets the ID of the model to use for embeddings. The default value is `text-embedding-3-small`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **chatModel** | Gets or sets the name of the Large Language Model to invoke for chat responses. The default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **systemPrompt** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the system prompt to use for prompting the large language model. The system prompt is appended with knowledge that is fetched as a result of the `Query`. The combined prompt is then sent to the OpenAI Chat API. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **maxKnowledgeCount** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the number of knowledge items to inject into the `SystemPrompt`.|
