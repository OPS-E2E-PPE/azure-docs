# Azure Tables bindings for Azure Functions

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Tables](../cosmos-db/table/introduction.md) via [triggers and bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md). Integrating with Azure Tables allows you to build functions that read and write data using the Tables API for [Azure Storage](../storage/index.yml) and [Cosmos DB](../cosmos-db/introduction.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Table bindings have historically only supported Azure Storage. Support for Cosmos DB is currently in preview. See [Table API extension (preview)](#table-api-extension).

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Read table data in a function | [Input binding](./functions-bindings-storage-table-input.md) |
| Allow a function to write table data |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-storage-table-output.md) |

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running functions on .NET 5.0 in Azure](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

# [C# script](#tab/csharp-script)

Functions run as C# script, which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. To update existing binding extensions for C# script apps running in the portal without having to republish your function app, see [Update your extensions].

The process for installing the extension varies depending on the extension version:

<a name="storage-extension"></a>
<a name="table-api-extension"></a>

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/in-process)


Working with the bindings requires that you reference the appropriate NuGet package. Tables are included in a combined package for Azure Storage. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage NuGet package][storage-4.x], version 3.x or 4.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tables have been moved out of this package starting in its 5.x version. You need to instead use version 4.x of the extension NuGet package or additionally include the [Table API extension](#table-api-extension) when using version 5.x.

# [Table API extension (preview)](#tab/table-api/in-process)

A new Table API extension is now in preview. The new version introduces the ability to use Cosmos DB Table APIs and to [connect to Azure Storage using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the tutorial [creating a function app with identity-based connections](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md). For .NET applications, the new extension version also changes the types that you can bind to, replacing the types from `WindowsAzure.Storage` and `Microsoft.Azure.Storage` with newer types from [Azure.Data.Tables](/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables).

This new extension is available by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables NuGet package][table-api-package] to a project using version 5.x or higher of the storage extension for [blobs](./functions-bindings-storage-blob.md?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5) and [queues](./functions-bindings-storage-queue.md?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5).

Using the .NET CLI:

```dotnetcli
# Install the Tables API extension
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables --version 1.0.0-beta.1

# Update the combined Azure Storage extension (to a version which no longer includes Tables)
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage --version 5.0.0
``` 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you install the Table API extension with the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables NuGet package][table-api-package], ensure that you are using [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage version 5.x or higher][storage-5.x], as prior versions of that package also include the older version of the table bindings. Using an older version of the storage extension will result in conflicts.

Any existing functions in your project which use table bindings may need to be updated to account for changes in allowed parameter types.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/in-process)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

[!INCLUDE [functions-storage-sdk-version](../../includes/functions-storage-sdk-version.md)]

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/isolated-process)

Tables are included in a combined package for Azure Storage. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/4.0.4), version 4.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tables have been moved out of this package starting in its 5.x version. You need to instead use version 4.x.

# [Table API extension (preview)](#tab/table-api/isolated-process)

The Table API extension does not currently support isolated process. You will instead need to use the [Storage extension](#storage-extension).

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/isolated-process)

Functions version 1.x doesn't support isolated process.

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/csharp-script)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Version 3.x of the extension bundle doesn't include the Table Storage bindings. You need to instead use version 2.x for now.

# [Table API extension (preview)](#tab/table-api/csharp-script)

Version 3.x of the extension bundle doesn't currently include the Table API bindings. For now, you need to instead use version 2.x of the extension bundle, which uses the [Storage extension](#storage-extension).

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/csharp-script)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

## Install bundle

The Azure Tables bindings are part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your host.json project file. You may need to modify this bundle to change the version of the bindings, or if bundles aren't already installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].

# [Bundle v3.x](#tab/extensionv3)

Version 3.x of the extension bundle doesn't currently include the Azure Tables bindings. You need to instead use version 2.x of the extension bundle.

# [Bundle v2.x](#tab/extensionv2)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functions1)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the extension.
