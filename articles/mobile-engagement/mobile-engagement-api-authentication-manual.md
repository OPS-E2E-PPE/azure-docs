# Authenticate with Mobile Engagement REST APIs - manual setup
This documentation is an appendix documentation to [Authenticate with Mobile Engagement REST APIs](mobile-engagement-api-authentication.md). Make sure you read it first to get the context.
It describes an alternate way to do the One-time setup for setting up your authentication for the Mobile Engagement REST APIs using the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The following instructions are based on this [Active Directory guide](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal.md) and customized for what is required for authentication for Mobile Engagement APIs. So refer to it if you want to understand the steps below in detail.

1. Log in to your Azure Account through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Active Directory** from the left pane.

     ![select Active Directory][1]

3. To view the applications in your directory, click on **App registrations**.

     ![view applications][3]

4. Click on **New application registration**.

     ![add application][4]

5. Fill in name of the application and leave the type of application as **Web app/API** and click the next button. You can provide any dummy URLs for **SIGN-ON URL**: They are not used for this scenario and the URLs themselves are not validated.
6. Once done, you have an Azure AD app with the name you provided. It is your **AD\_APP\_NAME**, please make a note of it.

     ![app name][8]

7. Click on the app name.
8. Find **Application ID**, make a note of it, it is be the CLIENT ID that is to be used as **CLIENT\_ID** for your API calls.

     ![configure app][10]

9. Find the **Keys** section on the right.

     ![configure app][11]

10. Create a new key and immediately copy it and save it for use. It will never be shown again.

     ![configure app][12]

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This key expires at the end of the duration that you specified so make sure to renew it when the time comes otherwise your API authentication will not work anymore. You can also delete and recreate this key if you think that it has been compromised.
    >
    >
11. Click on **Endpoints** button at the top of the page and copy the **OAUTH 2.0 TOKEN ENDPOINT**.

    ![][14]

16. This endpoint will be in the following form where the GUID in the URL is your **TENANT_ID** so make a note of it: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<GUID>/oauth2/token`
17. Now we will proceed to configure the permissions on this app. For this you will have to open up the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
18. Click on **Resource Groups** and find the **Mobile Engagement** resource group.

    ![][15]

19. Click the **Mobile Engagement** resource group and navigate to the **Settings** section here.

    ![][16]

20. Click on **Users** in the Settings section and then click on **Add** to add a user.

    ![][17]

21. Click on **Select a role**.

    ![][18]

22. Click on **Owner**.

    ![][19]

23. Search for the name of your application **AD\_APP\_NAME** in the Search box. You will not see this by default here. Once you find it, select it and click on **Select** at the bottom of the section.

    ![][20]

24. On the **Add Access** section, it will show up as **1 user, 0 groups**. Click **OK** on this section to confirm the change.

    ![][21]

You have now completed the required Azure AD configuration and you are all set to call the APIs.
