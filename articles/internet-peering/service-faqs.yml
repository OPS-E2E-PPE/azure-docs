    questions:
      - question: |
          Can a carrier use their existing Direct peering with Microsoft to support Peering Service?
        answer: |
          Yes, a carrier can use its existing Private Network Interconnect (PNI) to support Peering Service. A Peering Service PNI requires redundancy to support HA. If existing PNI already has diversity, then no new infrastructure is required. If existing PNI needs diversity, then it can be augmented.

      - question: |
          Can a carrier use new Direct peering with Microsoft to support Peering Service?
        answer: |
          Yes, that is also possible. Microsoft works with the carrier to create new Direct peering to support Peering Service.  

      - question: |
          Why is Direct peering a requirement to support Peering Service?
        answer: |
          One of primary drivers behind Peering Service is to provide connectivity to Microsoft online services through a well-connected SP. Direct peering is in the Gbps range and hence a fundamental building block for high throughput connectivity between carrier and Microsoft.

      - question: |
          What are the redundancy requirements on a Direct peering to support Peering Service?
        answer: |
          A Direct peering must support local-redundancy and geo-redundancy. Local-redundancy is defined as two different paths in a particular peering site. Geo-redundancy requires that the carrier has connectivity at a different Microsoft edge site in case the primary site fails. For the short failure duration carrier can route traffic through the backup site.

      - question: |
          The carrier already offers SLA and enterprise grade internet, how is this offering different?
        answer: |
          Some carriers offer SLA and enterprise grade internet on their part of the network. In Peering Service, Microsoft offers SLA for traffic on Microsoft part of the network. By selecting Peering Service, you get end-to-end SLA. The ISP provides SLA for traffic traveling on its network from your site to Microsoft edge. Microsoft provides SLA for traffic traveling in Microsoft global network from Microsoft edge to end users application.

      - question: |
          If a service provider already peers with Microsoft using Direct peering, then what kind of changes are required to support Peering Service?
        answer: |
          * Software changes to identify a Peering Service user and its traffic. May require routing policy changes to exchange a user's traffic at the nearest Microsoft edge through Peering Service connection.
          * Ensure the connectivity has local-redundancy and geo-redundancy.
