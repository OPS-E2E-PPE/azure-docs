# Handling planned maintenance notifications for Linux virtual machines

Azure periodically performs updates to improve the reliability, performance, and security of the host infrastructure for virtual machines. Updates are changes like patching the hosting environment or upgrading and decommissioning hardware. The majority of these updates are performed without any impact to the hosted virtual machines. However, there are cases where updates do have an impact:

- If the maintenance does not require a reboot, Azure uses in-place migration to pause the VM while the host is updated.

- If maintenance requires a reboot, you get a notice of when the maintenance is planned. In these cases, you are given a time window where you can start the maintenance yourself, when it works for you.


Planned maintenance that requires a reboot, is scheduled in waves. Each wave has different scope (regions).

- A wave starts with a notification to customers. By default, notification is sent to subscription owner and co-owners. You can add more recipients and messaging options like email, SMS, and Webhooks, to the notifications. 
- Soon after the notification, a self-service window is set. During this window, you can find which of your virtual machines is included in this wave and start maintenance using proactive redeploy. 
- Following the self-service window, a scheduled maintenance window begins. At this time, Azure schedules and applies the required maintenance to your virtual machine.  

The goal in having two windows is to give you enough time to start maintenance and reboot your virtual machine while knowing when Azure will automatically start maintenance.

You can use the Azure CLI, PowerShell, REST API, and the Azure portal to query for the maintenance windows for your VMs and start self-service maintenance.

 > [!NOTE]
 > If you try to start maintenance and fail, Azure marks your VM as **skipped** and it is not reboot during the scheduled maintenance window. Instead, you are contacted in a later time with a new schedule. 

## Find VMs scheduled for maintenance using CLI

Planned maintenance information can be seen using [azure vm get-instance-view](/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az_vm_get_instance_view).
 
Maintenance information is returned only if there is maintenance planned. If there is no maintenance scheduled that impacts the VM, the command does not return any maintenance information. 

```azure-cli
az vm get-instance-view  - g rgName  -n vmName 
```

The following values are returned under MaintenanceRedeployStatus: 

| Value	| Description	|
|-------|---------------|
| IsCustomerInitiatedMaintenanceAllowed | Indicates whether you can start maintenance on the VM at this time ||
| PreMaintenanceWindowStartTime         | The beginning of the maintenance self-service window when you can initiate maintenance on your VM ||
| PreMaintenanceWindowEndTime           | The end of the maintenance self-service window when you can initiate maintenance on your VM ||
| MaintenanceWindowStartTime            | The beginning of the maintenance scheduled window when you can initiate maintenance on your VM ||
| MaintenanceWindowEndTime              | The end of the maintenance scheduled window when you can initiate maintenance on your VM ||
| LastOperationResultCode               | The result of the last attempt to initiate maintenance on the VM ||


## Start maintenance on your VM using CLI

The following call will initiate maintenance on a VM if `IsCustomerInitiatedMaintenanceAllowed` is set to true.

```azure-cli
az vm perform-maintenance rgName vmName 
```

Learn how you can register for maintenance events from within the VM using [Scheduled Events](scheduled-events.md).
