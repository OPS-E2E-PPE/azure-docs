# Get started with SAP automation framework on Azure

Get started quickly with the [SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework](automation-deployment-framework.md).

## Prerequisites


- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Ability to [download of the SAP software](automation-software.md) in your Azure environment.
- A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installation. For more information, also see the [Terraform on Azure documentation](/azure/developer/terraform/).
- An [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installation on your local computer.
- A Service Principal to use for the control plane deployment
- Optionally, if you want to use PowerShell:
    - An [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps#update-the-azure-powershell-module) installation on your local computer.
    - The latest PowerShell modules. [Update the PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps#update-the-azure-powershell-module) if needed.

Some of the prerequisites may already be installed in your deployment environment. Both Cloud Shell and the deployer have Terraform and the Azure CLI installed.
## Clone the repository

Clone the repository and prepare the execution environment by using the following steps:

- Create a directory called `Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment` for your automation framework deployment. 

```bash
mkdir ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/config; cd $_
git clone https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-bootstrap.git 

mkdir ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/sap-automation; cd $_
git clone https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation.git 

mkdir ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/samples; cd $_
git clone https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-samples.git 
```


> [!TIP]
> The deployer already clones the required repositories. 

## Samples

The ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/samples folder contains a set of sample configuration files to start testing the deployment automation framework. You can copy them using the following steps.


```bash
cd ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment

cp -Rp samples/Terraform/WORKSPACES config/WORKSPACES
```
