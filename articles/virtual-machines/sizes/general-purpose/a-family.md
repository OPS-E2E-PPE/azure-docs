# A family general purpose VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The 'A' family of VM size series are one of Azure's general purpose VM instances. They're designed for entry-level workloads, such as development and test environments, small to medium databases, and low-traffic web servers.

## Workloads and use cases

- **Cost Efficiency:** A-series VMs are some of the most budget-friendly options available on Azure, making them a good choice for projects with limited financial resources or those that do not require high-performance compute capabilities.

- **General Workloads:** They are well-suited for handling basic applications, light web servers, and small databases that do not demand extensive CPU, memory, or I/O performance.

- **Entry-Level Applications:** These VMs can serve as a good starting point for deploying applications that are not expected to scale significantly. They provide a platform for applications and services that require less processing power.
