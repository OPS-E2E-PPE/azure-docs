# 'FX' family general purpose VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The 'FX' family of VM size series are one of Azure's specialized compute-optimized VM instances, designed primarily workloads that require significant CPU capabilities. These VMs leverage the latest Intel Ice Lake processors and are optimized for compute-intensive tasks such as financial modeling, scientific simulations, and heavy calculations. With a high frequency and a large cache per core, FX-series VMs provide exceptional computational power, making them ideal for scenarios demanding extensive processing resources and rapid execution of complex operations.

## Workloads and use cases

**Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**: FX-series VMs are well-suited for EDA workloads, which require high CPU clock speeds and high memory-to-CPU ratios. These workloads benefit from the high single-core performance and large memory capacity of FX-series VMs.

**Batch Processing:** FX-series VMs are excellent for high-throughput batch processing jobs, such as those involving large-scale data analysis and transformation, where rapid processing is critical.

**Data Analytics:** FX-series VMs are suitable for intensive data analytics applications, especially those that require quick iteration and processing of large data sets.
