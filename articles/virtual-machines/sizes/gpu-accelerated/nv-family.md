# 'NV' sub-family GPU accelerated VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The 'NV' family of VM size series are one of Azure's GPU-accelerated VM instances, specifically designed for graphics-intensive applications such as graphics rendering, simulation, and virtual desktops. Equipped with NVIDIA GPUs, NV-series VMs provide a robust platform for rendering and processing graphics-heavy tasks, making them ideal for organizations that require virtual workstations with powerful graphical capabilities. These VMs support scenarios where remote visualization, real-time collaboration, and 3D visualization are necessary, allowing users to efficiently run graphic-intensive applications directly from Azure's cloud environment.

## Workloads and use cases

**Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):** NV-family VMs are well-suited for virtual desktops that require GPU capabilities for tasks such as graphic design, video editing, and CAD applications. They provide the graphical performance necessary for smooth operation in remote desktop scenarios.

**3D Visualization:** NV-family VMs are ideal for running 3D applications that demand high-performance rendering, such as architectural visualizations, medical imaging, and other professional-grade graphics tasks.

**Remote Graphics Work:** NV-series VMs are beneficial for industries that rely on graphics-intensive software, allowing professionals to access and use applications like Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk AutoCAD, or Dassault SOLIDWORKS remotely with near-native performance.

**High-Resolution Image Processing:** NV-series VMs are ideal for handling extremely large vRAM applications such as high-resolution image processing and analysis. This includes tasks in fields like geospatial analysis, satellite image processing, and professional photo editing, where handling massive image files and performing complex manipulations in real-time are crucial for productivity and performance.

**Video Streaming:** NV-family VMs are suitable for streaming high-resolution video content, including training videos and virtual events, ensuring high-quality delivery without local hardware constraints.
