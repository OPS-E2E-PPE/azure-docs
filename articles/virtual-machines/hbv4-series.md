# HBv4-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

HBv4-series VMs are optimized for various HPC workloads such as computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, frontend and backend EDA, rendering, molecular dynamics, computational geoscience, weather simulation, and financial risk analysis. During preview, HBv4 VMs will feature up to 176 AMD EPYCâ„¢ 9004-series (Genoa) CPU cores, 688 GB of RAM, and no simultaneous multithreading. HBv4-series VMs also provide 800 GB/s of DDR5 memory bandwidth and 768MB L3 cache per VM, up to 12 GB/s (reads) and 7 GB/s (writes) of block device SSD performance, and clock frequencies up to 3.7 GHz.

> [!NOTE] 
> At General Availability, Azure HBv4-series VMs will automatically be upgraded to Genoa-X processors featuring 3D V-Cache. Updates to technical specifications for HBv4 will be posted at that time.

All HBv4-series VMs feature 400 Gb/s NDR InfiniBand from NVIDIA Networking to enable supercomputer-scale MPI workloads. These VMs are connected in a non-blocking fat tree for optimized and consistent RDMA performance. NDR continues to support features like Adaptive Routing and the Dynamically Connected Transport (DCT). This newest generation of InfiniBand also brings greater support for offload of MPI collectives, optimized real-world latencies due to congestion control intelligence, and enhanced adaptive routing capabilities. These features enhance application performance, scalability, and consistency, and their usage is recommended.
