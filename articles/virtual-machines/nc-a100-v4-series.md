#  NC A100 v4-series (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NC A100 v4-series of Azure virtual machines (VMs) is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
> To use this preview feature, [sign up for the NC A100 v4 series preview](https://aka.ms/AzureNCA100v4Signup).  

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The NC A100 v4 series virtual machine (VM) is a new addition to the Azure GPU family. You can use this series for real-world Azure Applied AI training and batch inference workloads. 

The NC A100 v4 series is powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and 3rd-generation AMD Epycâ„¢ 7V13 (Milan) processors.  The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. 
These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as: 

- GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
- Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
- Autonomous driving reinforcement learning
- Oil and gas reservoir simulation
- Machine learning (ML) development
- Video processing
- AI/ML web services



## Supported features

To get started with NC A100 v4 VMs, refer to [HPC Workload Configuration and Optimization](./workloads/hpc/configure.md) for steps including driver and network configuration.

Due to increased GPU memory I/O footprint, the NC A100 v4 requires the use of [Generation 2 VMs](./generation-2.md) and marketplace images. The [Azure HPC images](./workloads/hpc/configure.md) are strongly recommended. Azure HPC Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and Azure HPC CentOS 7.9 images are supported. Windows Service 2019 and Windows Service 2022 images are supported.
 
Key Features:    
- [Premium Storage](premium-storage-performance.md)             
- [Premium Storage caching](premium-storage-performance.md)      
- [Ultra Disks](disks-types.md#ultra-disks)                      
- [VM Generation 2](generation-2.md)   
- [Accelerated Networking](../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli.md) 
- [Ephemeral OS Disks](ephemeral-os-disks.md)  
- NVIDIA NVLink Interconnect  

These features are not supported:[Live Migration](maintenance-and-updates.md), [Memory Preserving Updates](maintenance-and-updates.md) and [Nested Virtualization](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization) .
