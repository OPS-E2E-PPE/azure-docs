# Install OT monitoring software on OT sensors

Use the procedures in this article when installing Microsoft Defender for IoT software on OT network sensors. You might be reinstalling software on a [pre-configured appliance](../ot-pre-configured-appliances.md), or you may be installing software on your own appliance.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Microsoft Defender for IoT, make sure that you have:

- [Traffic mirroring configured in your network](../best-practices/traffic-mirroring-methods.md)
- An [OT plan in Defender for IoT](../how-to-manage-subscriptions.md) on your Azure subscription
- An OT sensor [onboarded to Defender for IoT](../onboard-sensors.md) in the Azure portal

Each appliance type also comes with its own set of instructions that are required before installing Defender for IoT software. Make sure that you've completed any specific procedures required for your appliance before installing Defender for IoT software.

For more information, see:

- The [OT monitoring appliance catalog](../appliance-catalog/index.yml)
- [Which appliances do I need?](../ot-appliance-sizing.md)
- [OT monitoring with virtual appliances](../ot-virtual-appliances.md)

## Download software files from the Azure portal

Download the OT sensor software from Defender for IoT in the Azure portal.

On the Defender for IoT > **Getting started** page, select the **Sensor** or **Updates** tab and locate the software you need.

If you're updating from a previous version, check the options carefully to ensure that you have the correct update path for your situation.

## Install Defender or IoT software on OT sensors

This procedure describes how to install OT monitoring software on a sensor.

> [!Note]
> Towards the end of this process you will be presented with the usernames and passwords for your device. Make sure to copy these down as these passwords will not be presented again.

1. Mount the ISO file onto your hardware appliance or VM using one of the following options:

    - **Physical media** – burn the ISO file to your external storage, and then boot from the media.

        -	DVDs: First burn the software to the DVD as an image
        -	USB drive: First make sure that you’ve created a bootable USB drive with software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), and then save the software to the USB drive. USB drives must have USB version 3.0 or later.

        Your physical media must have a minimum of 4-GB storage.

    - **Virtual mount** – use iLO for HPE appliances, or iDRAC for Dell appliances to boot the ISO file.

1. When the installation boots, you're first prompted to select the hardware profile you want to install.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor's hardware profile options." lightbox="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-architecture.png":::

    For more information, see [Which appliances do I need?](../ot-appliance-sizing.md).

    System files are installed, the sensor reboots, and then sensor files are installed. This process can take a few minutes.

    When the installation steps are complete, the Ubuntu **Package configuration** screen is displayed, with the `Configuring iot-sensor` wizard, showing a prompt to  select your monitor interfaces.

    In this wizard, use the up or down arrows to navigate, and the SPACE bar to select an option. Press ENTER to advance to the next screen.

1. In the `Select monitor interfaces` screen, select the interfaces you want to monitor.

    > [!IMPORTANT] 
    > Make sure that you select only interfaces that are connected. 
    > If you select interfaces that are enabled but not connected, the sensor will show a *No traffic monitored* health notification in the Azure portal. If you connect more traffic sources after installation and want to monitor them with Defender for IoT, you can add them via the CLI.    

    By default, `eno1` is reserved for the management interface and we recommend that you leave this option unselected.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/monitor-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the select monitor interface screen.":::

1. In the `Select erspan monitor interfaces` screen, select any ERSPAN monitoring ports that you have. The wizard lists available interfaces, even if you don't have any ERSPAN monitoring ports in your system. If you have no ERSPAN monitoring ports, leave all options unselected.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/erspan-monitor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the select erspan monitor screen.":::

1. In the `Select management interface` screen, we recommend keeping the default `eno1` value selected as the management interface.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/management-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the management interface select screen.":::

1. In the `Enter sensor IP address` screen, enter the IP address for the sensor appliance you're installing.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-ip-address.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor IP address screen.":::

1. In the `Enter path to the mounted backups folder` screen, enter the path to the sensor's mounted backups. We recommend using the default path of `/opt/sensor/persist/backups`. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/mounted-backups-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the mounted backup path screen.":::

1. In the `Enter Subnet Mask` screen, enter the IP address for the sensor's subnet mask. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-subnet-ip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enter Subnet Mask screen.":::

1. In the `Enter Gateway` screen, enter the sensor's default gateway IP address. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-gateway-ip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enter Gateway screen.":::

1. In the `Enter DNS server` screen, enter the sensor's DNS server IP address. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-dns-ip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enter DNS server screen.":::

1. In the `Enter hostname` screen, enter the sensor hostname. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-hostname.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enter hostname screen.":::

1. In the `Run this sensor as a proxy server (Preview)` screen, select `<Yes>` only if you want to configure a proxy, and then enter the proxy credentials as prompted.

    The default configuration is without a proxy.

    For more information, see [Connect Microsoft Defender for IoT sensors without direct internet access by using a proxy (version 10.x)](../how-to-connect-sensor-by-proxy.md).


1. <a name=credentials></a>The installation process starts running and then shows the credentials screen. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/login-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the final screen of the installation with usernames, and passwords.":::

    Save the usernames and passwords listed, as the passwords are unique and this is the only time that the credentials are shown. Copy the credentials to a safe place so that you can use them when signing into the sensor for the first time.

    For more information, see [Default privileged on-premises users](../roles-on-premises.md#default-privileged-on-premises-users).

    Select `<Ok>` when you're ready to continue.

    The installation continues running again, and then reboots when the installation is complete. Upon reboot, you're prompted to enter credentials to sign in. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sensor sign-in screen after installation.":::

1. Enter the credentials for one of the users that you'd copied down in the [previous step](#credentials).

    - If the `iot-sensor login:` prompt disappears, press **ENTER** to have it shown again.
    - When you enter your password, the password characters don't display on the screen. Make sure you enter them carefully.

    When you've successfully signed in, the following confirmation screen appears:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/install-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sign-in confirmation.":::

Make sure that your sensor is connected to your network, and then you can sign in to your sensor via a network-connected browser. For more information, see [Activate and set up your sensor](../how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor.md#activate-and-set-up-your-sensor).
