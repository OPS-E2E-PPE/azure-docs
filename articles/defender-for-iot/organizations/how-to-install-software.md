# Defender for IoT software installation

This article describes how to install software for OT sensors and on-premises management consoles. You might need the procedures in this article if you're reinstalling software on a preconfigured appliance, or if you've chosen to install software on your own appliances.


## Pre-installation configuration

Each appliance type comes with its own set of instructions that are required before installing Defender for IoT software.

Make sure that you've completed the procedures as instructed in the **Reference > OT monitoring appliance** section of our documentation before installing Defender for IoT software.

For more information, see:

- [Which appliances do I need?](ot-appliance-sizing.md)
- [Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring](ot-pre-configured-appliances.md), including the catalog of available appliances
- [OT monitoring with virtual appliances](ot-virtual-appliances.md)

## Download software files from the Azure portal

Make sure that you've downloaded the relevant software file for the sensor or on-premises management console.

You can obtain the latest versions of our OT sensor and on-premises management console software from the Azure portal, on the Defender for IoT > **Getting started** page. Select the **Sensor**, **On-premises management console**, or **Updates** tab and locate the software you need.

Mount the ISO file using one of the following options:

- **Physical media** – burn the ISO file to a DVD or USB, and boot from the media.

- **Virtual mount** – use iLO for HPE appliances, or iDRAC for Dell appliances to boot the ISO file.

   | **configure a subnet mask for the sensor monitoring interface** | Enter an IP address |

1. Accept the settings and continue by typing `Y`.

1. After about 10 minutes, the two sets of credentials appear. One is for a **CyberX** user, and one is for a **Support** user.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/credentials-screen.png" alt-text="Copy these credentials as they won't be presented again.":::

   Save the usernames and passwords, you'll need these credentials to access the platform the first time you use it.

1. Select **Enter** to continue.

For information on how to find the physical port on your appliance, see [Find your port](#find-your-port).

### Add a secondary NIC (optional)

You can enhance security to your on-premises management console by adding a secondary NIC dedicated for attached sensors within an IP address range. By adding a secondary NIC, the first will be dedicated for end-users, and the secondary will support the configuration of a gateway for routed networks.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/secondary-nic.png" alt-text="The overall architecture of the secondary NIC.":::

Both NICs will support the user interface (UI). If you choose not to deploy a secondary NIC, all of the features will be available through the primary NIC.

This procedure describes how to add a secondary NIC if you've already installed your on-premises management console.

**To add a secondary NIC**:

1. Use the network reconfigure command:

    ```bash
    sudo cyberx-management-network-reconfigure
    ```

1. Enter the following responses to the following questions:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/network-reconfig-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the required answers to configure your appliance. ":::

    | Parameters | Response to enter |
    |--|--|
    | **Management Network IP address** | `N` |
    | **Subnet mask** | `N` |
    | **DNS** | `N` |
    | **Default gateway IP Address** | `N` |
    | **Sensor monitoring interface** <br>Optional. Relevant when sensors are on a different network segment.| `Y`, and select a possible value |
    | **An IP address for the sensor monitoring interface** | `Y`, and enter an IP address that's  accessible by the sensors|
    | **A subnet mask for the sensor monitoring interface** | `Y`, and enter an IP address that's  accessible by the sensors|
    | **Hostname** | Enter the hostname |

1. Review all choices and enter `Y` to accept the changes. The system reboots.

### Find your port

If you are having trouble locating the physical port on your device, you can use the following command to find your port:

```bash
sudo ethtool -p <port value> <time-in-seconds>
```

This command will cause the light on the port to flash for the specified time period. For example, entering `sudo ethtool -p eno1 120`, will have port eno1 flash for 2 minutes, allowing you to find the port on the back of your appliance.


## Post-installation validation

To validate the installation of a physical appliance, you need to perform many tests. The same validation process applies to all the appliance types.

Perform the validation by using the GUI or the CLI. The validation is available to both the **Support** and **CyberX** users.

Post-installation validation must include the following tests:

- **Sanity test**: Verify that the system is running.

- **Version**: Verify that the version is correct.

- **ifconfig**: Verify that all the input interfaces configured during the installation process are running.

### Check system health

Check your system health from the sensor or on-premises management console. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/system-health-check-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the system health check.":::

#### Sanity

- **Appliance**: Runs the appliance sanity check. You can perform the same check by using the CLI command `system-sanity`.

- **Version**: Displays the appliance version.

- **Network Properties**: Displays the sensor network parameters.

#### Redis

- **Memory**: Provides the overall picture of memory usage, such as how much memory was used and how much remained.

- **Longest Key**: Displays the longest keys that might cause extensive memory usage.

#### System

- **Core Log**: Provides the last 500 rows of the core log, so that you can view the recent log rows without exporting the entire system log.

- **Task Manager**: Translates the tasks that appear in the table of processes to the following layers:
  
  - Persistent layer (Redis)

  - Cash layer (SQL)

- **Network Statistics**: Displays your network statistics.

- **TOP**: Shows the table of processes. It's a Linux command that provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system.

- **Backup Memory Check**: Provides the status of the backup memory, checking the following:

  - The location of the backup folder

  - The size of the backup folder

  - The limitations of the backup folder

  - When the last backup happened

  - How much space there are for the extra backup files

- **ifconfig**: Displays the parameters for the appliance's physical interfaces.

- **CyberX nload**: Displays network traffic and bandwidth by using the six-second tests.

- **Errors from Core, log**: Displays errors from the core log file.

**To access the tool**:

1. Sign in to the sensor with the **Support** user credentials.

1. Select **System Statistics** from the **System Settings** window.

## Access sensors from the on-premises management console

You can enhance system security by preventing direct user access to the sensor. Instead, use proxy tunneling to let users access the sensor from the on-premises management console with a single firewall rule. This technique narrows the possibility of unauthorized access to the network environment beyond the sensor. The user's experience when signing in to the sensor remains the same.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-system-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows access to the sensor.":::

**To enable tunneling**:

1. Sign in to the on-premises management console's CLI with the **CyberX** or the **Support** user credentials.

1. Enter `sudo cyberx-management-tunnel-enable`.

1. Select **Enter**.

1. Enter `--port 10000`.
