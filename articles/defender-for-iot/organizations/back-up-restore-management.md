# Back up and restore the on-premises management console

Back up and restore your on-premises management console to help protect against hard drive failures and data loss. In this article, learn how to:

- Define backup and restore settings
- Run an unscheduled backup via CLI
- Use an SMB server to save your backup files to an external server
- Restore the on-premises management console from the latest backup via CLI

## Define backup and restore settings

The on-premises management console is automatically backed up daily to the `/var/cyberx/backups` directory. Backup files do *not* include PCAP or log files, which must be manually backed up if needed.

We recommend that you configure your on-premises management console to automatically transfer backup files to your own, internal network.

> [!NOTE]
> Backup files can be used to restore an on-premises management console only if the on-premises management console's current software version is the same as the version in the backup file.

## Start an immediate, unscheduled backup via CLI

You may want to create a manual backup file, such as just after updating your OT sensor software.

To run a manual backup from the CLI:

1. Sign into the on-premises management console as a privileged user via SSH/Telnet.

1. Run:

   ```bash
   sudo cyberx-management-backup -full
   ```

## Save your backup file to an external server (SMB)

We recommend saving your on-premises management console sensor backup files on your internal network. To do this, you may want to use an SMB server. For example:

1. Create a shared folder on the external SMB server, and make sure that you have the folder's path and the credentials required to access the SMB server.

1. Sign into your on-premises management console via SFTP and create a directory for your backup files. Run:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /<backup_folder_name_on_ server>
   sudo chmod 777 /<backup_folder_name_on_c_server>/
   ```

1. Edit the `fstab` file with details about your backup folder. Run:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab

   add - //<server_IP>/<folder_path> /<backup_folder_name_on_server> cifs rw,credentials=/etc/samba/user,vers=3.0,uid=cyberx,gid=cyberx,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0
   ```

1. Edit and create credentials to share for the SMB server. Run:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/samba/user
   ```

1. Add your credentials as follows:

   ```bash
   username=<user name>
   password=<password>
   ```

1. Mount the backup directory. Run:

   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

1. Configure your backup directory on the SMB server to use the shared file on the OT sensor. Run:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /var/cyberx/properties/backup.properties`
    ```

    Set the `backup_directory_path` to the folder on your OT sensor where you want to save your backup files.

## Restore from the latest backup via CLI

To restore your OT sensor from the latest backup file via CLI:

1. Sign into the on-premises management console as a privileged user via SSH/Telnet.

1. Run:

    ```bash
    $â€¯sudo cyberx-management-system-restore
    ```
