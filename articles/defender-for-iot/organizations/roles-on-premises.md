# On-premises users and roles for OT monitoring with Defender for IoT

When working with OT networks, Defender for IoT services and data is available from on-premises OT network sensors and the on-premises sensor management consoles, in addition to Azure.

This article provides:

- A description of the default, privileged users that come with Defender for IoT software installation
- A reference of the actions available for each on-premises user role, on both OT network sensors and the on-premises management console

## Default privileged on-premises users

By default, each [sensor](ot-deploy/install-software-ot-sensor.md) and [on-premises management console](ot-deploy/install-software-on-premises-management-console.md) is installed  with the *cyberx* and *support* privileged users. OT sensors are also installed with the *cyberx_host* privileged user.

Privileged users have access to advanced tools for troubleshooting and setup, such as the CLI. When first setting up your sensor or on-premises management console, first sign in with one of the privileged users. Then create an initial user with an **Admin** role, and then use that admin user to create other users with other roles.

On the sensor, the default passwords created for the *cyber* and *cyberx_host* users are identical.

The following table describes each default privileged user in detail:

|Username  |Connects to  |Permissions  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**cyberx**     |   The sensor or on-premises management console's `sensor_app` container      | Serves as a root user within the main application. <br><br>Used for troubleshooting with advanced root access.<br><br>Can access the container filesystem, commands, and dedicated CLI commands for controlling OT monitoring.  <br><br>Can recover or change passwords for users with any roles. |
|**support**     |   The sensor or on-premises management console's `sensor_app` container       | Serves as a locked-down, user shell for dedicated CLI tools.<br><br>Has no filesystem access.<br><br>Can access only dedicated CLI commands for controlling OT monitoring. <br><br>Can recover or change passwords for the *support* user, and any user with the **Admin**, **Security Analyst**, and **Read-only** roles.  |
|**cyberx_host**     | The on-premises management console's host OS        | Serves as a root user in the on-premises management console's host OS.<br><br>Used for support scenarios with containers and filesystem access.        |

Supported CLI commands and command syntax differ for each user. For more information, see [Defender for IoT CLI users and access](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md) and [CLI command reference from OT network sensors](cli-ot-sensor.md).

## On-premises user roles

The following roles are available on OT network sensors and on-premises management consoles:

|Role  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Admin**     |  Admin users have access to all tools, including system configurations, creating and managing users, and more.   |
|**Security Analyst**     |  Security Analysts don't have admin-level permissions for configurations, but can perform actions on devices, acknowledge alerts, and use investigation tools. <br><br>Security Analysts can access options on the sensor displayed in the **Discover** and **Analyze** menus on the sensor, and in the **NAVIGATION** and **ANALYSIS** menus on the on-premises management console.    |
|**Read Only**     | Read-only users perform tasks such as viewing alerts and devices on the device map. <br><br>Read Only users can access options displayed in the **Discover** and **Analyze** menus on the sensor, in read-only mode, and in the **NAVIGATION** menu on the on-premises management console.        |

When first deploying an OT monitoring system, sign in to your sensors and on-premises management console with one of the [default, privileged users](#default-privileged-on-premises-users) described above. Create your first **Admin** user, and then use that user to create other users and assign them to roles.

Permissions applied to each role differ between the sensor and the on-premises management console. For more information, see the tables below for the permissions available for each role, on the [sensor](#role-based-permissions-for-ot-network-sensors) and on the [on-premises management console](#role-based-permissions-for-the-on-premises-management-console).
