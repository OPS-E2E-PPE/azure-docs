# Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal

This article describes how to onboard, view, and manage sensors with [Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started).

## Onboard sensors

Onboard a sensor by registering it with Microsoft Defender for IoT and downloading a sensor activation file.

**Prerequisites**: Make sure that you've set up your sensor and configured your SPAN port or TAP. For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md).

**To onboard your sensor to Defender for IoT**:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Defender for IoT** > **Getting started** and select **Set up OT/ICS Security**. Alternately, from the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page, select **Onboard OT sensor**.

1. By default, on the **Set up OT/ICS Security** page, **Step 1: Did you set up a sensor?** and **Step 2: Configure SPAN port or TAPâ€‹** of the wizard are collapsed. If you haven't completed these steps, do so before continuing.

1. In **Step 3: Register this sensor with Microsoft Defender for IoT** enter or select the following values for your sensor:

    1. In the **Sensor name** field, enter a meaningful name for your sensor.  We recommend including your sensor's IP address as part of the name, or using another easily identifiable name, that can help you keep track between the registration name in the Azure portal and the IP address of the sensor shown in the sensor console.

    1. In the **Subscription** field, select your Azure subscription.

    1. Toggle on the **Cloud connected** option to have your sensor connected to other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel, and to push [threat intelligence packages](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md) from Defender for IoT to your sensors.

    1. In the **Sensor version** field, select which software version is installed on your sensor machine. We recommend that you select **22.X and above** to get all of the latest features and enhancements.

        If you haven't yet upgraded to version 22.x, see [Update a standalone sensor version](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#update-a-standalone-sensor-version) and [Reactivate a sensor for upgrades to version 22.x](#reactivate-a-sensor-for-upgrades-to-version-22x-from-a-legacy-version).

    1. In the **Site** section, select the **Resource name** and enter the **Display name** for your site. Add any tags as needed to help you identify your sensor.

    1. In the **Zone** field, select a zone from the menu, or select **Create Zone** to create a new one.

1. Select **Register**.

A success message appears and your activation file is automatically downloaded, and your sensor is now shown under the configured site on the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page.

However, until you activate your sensor, the sensor's status will show as **Pending Activation**.

Make the downloaded activation file accessible to the sensor console admin so that they can activate the sensor. For more information, see [Upload new activation files](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-new-activation-files).

## Manage on-boarded sensors

Sensors that you've on-boarded to Defender for IoT are listed on the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page. This page supports the following management tasks:

- **Export sensor data**. To export a CSV file with details about all sensors listed, select **Export** at the top of the page.

- **Edit sensor details**. To edit a sensor zone, or to toggle on/off the **Automatic Threat Intelligence Update** option, select the **...** options menu at the right of a sensor row > **Edit**.

    Make your changes as needed and select **Save**.

- **Delete a sensor**. Delete sensors if you're no longer working with them. Select the **...** options menu at the right of a sensor row > **Delete sensor**.

- **Download an activation file**. You'll need to download a new activation file for your sensor if you want to [reactivate the sensor](#reactivate-a-sensor). Select the **...** options menu at the right of a sensor row > **Download activation file**.

- **Prepare to update to 22.X**. Use this option specifically when upgrading sensors to version 22.x. For more information, see [below](#reactivate-a-sensor-for-upgrades-to-version-22x-from-a-legacy-version).

## Reactivate a sensor

You may need to reactivate your sensor because you want to:

- **Work in cloud-connected mode instead of locally managed mode**: After reactivation, existing sensor detections are displayed in the sensor console, and newly detected alert information is delivered through Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. This information can be shared with other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel.

- **Work in locally managed mode instead of cloud-connected mode**: After reactivation, sensor detection information is displayed only in the sensor console.

- **Associate the sensor to a new site**:  To do this, re-register the sensor with new site definitions and use the new activation file to activate.

In such cases, do the following:

1. [Delete your existing sensor](#manage-on-boarded-sensors).
1. [Onboard your sensor](#onboard-sensors), registering it again with any new settings.
1. [Upload your new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-new-activation-files).

### Reactivate a sensor for upgrades to version 22.x from a legacy version

This procedure describes how to reactivate a sensor specifically when upgrading to version 22.x from version 10.5.x.

**To reactivate your sensor after a legacy upgrade**:

1. Make sure that your sensor is fully upgraded. For more information, see [Update a standalone sensor version](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#update-a-standalone-sensor-version).

1. In Defender for IoT, select **Sites and sensors** on the left.

1. Select the site where you want to update your sensor, and then navigate to the sensor you want to update.

1. Expand the row for your sensor, select the options **...** menu on the right of the row, and then select **Prepare to update to 22.x**.

1. In the **Prepare to update sensor to version 22.X** message, select **Let's go**.

1. When the new activation file is ready, download it and verify that the sensor status has switched to **Pending activation**.

1. Use your newly downloaded activation file to activate your upgraded sensor.

    1. On your sensor, select **System settings > Sensor management > Subscription & Mode Activation**.

    1. In the **Subscription & Mode Activation** pane that appears on the right, select **Select file**, and then browse to and select your new activation file.

1. In Defender for IoT on the Azure portal, monitor your sensor's activation status. When the sensor is fully activated:

    - The sensor's **Overview** page shows an activation status of **Valid**.
    - In the Azure portal, on the **Sites and sensors** page, the sensor is listed as **OT cloud connected** and with the updated sensor version.

Your legacy sensors will continue to appear in the **Sites and sensors** page until you delete them. For more information, see [above](#manage-on-boarded-sensors).
