# Enterprise IoT network protection

The Microsoft Defender for IoT team is responsible for securing IoT and operational technology (OT) devices end-to-end, whether they're connected to IT, OT, or dedicated IoT networks.  

Enterprise IoT network protection extends agentless capabilities beyond operational environments and into enterprise environments. This protection provides coverage for the entire breadth of IoT devices in these environments, devices that include corporate printers, cameras, and purpose-built or proprietary devices.

The expansion of IoT into the enterprise network creates a unique opportunity to apply the asset-discovery capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender.

## Integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

You can now integrate Defender for IoT with Defender for Endpoint. When you do so, you're combining Defender for Endpoint device-discovery and agentless monitoring capabilities to help secure enterprise IoT devices that are connected to an IT network. Two examples of such devices are Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones and smart TVs. The result of this integration is a single, integrated solution that helps secure your entire IoT and OT infrastructure.

With this integration, you can use Defender for IoT sensors as additional data sources. Defender for IoT sensors provide visibility into areas of your network where Defender for Endpoint is not deployed and employees need to access data remotely. These sensors also provide visibility into IoT-to-IoT and IoT-to-internet communications.

After you've enabled this integration, any devices that are discovered on the network by either Defender for Iot or Defender for Endpoint will be synced automatically across both portals.

To learn how to integrate Defender for Endpoint with your Defender for IoT solution, see the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint documentation.

## Automatic discovery for IT, IoT, and OT

Use passive, agentless network monitoring to gain insight into your entire inventory of IT, IoT, and OT devices. The discovery process continuously identifies and classifies devices in your network, and it resolves all device details, with zero effect on the network.  

## Single pane of glass

A centralized user experience lets your security team visualize and secure all IT, IoT, and OT devices, no matter where they're located.

## The power of unified SIEM and XDR  

Defender for IoT shares its high-resolution signal data with Microsoft Defender 365 and Microsoft Sentinel. This sharing accelerates incident response and provides a bird's eye view across IT, OT, and IoT boundaries. 

Defender for IoT shares rich telemetry data seamlessly with security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR) platforms, such as Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender. It also interoperates with other Security Operations Center (SOC) tools, such as Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ServiceNow. Azure Sentinel customers no longer need to switch consoles to put the story together.  

## Easy deployment for a scalable solution

Defender for IoT helps ensure a quick, frictionless deployment of network sensor appliances, both physical and virtual.
