# Manage your IoT devices with the device inventory for organizations

> [!NOTE]
> The **Device inventory** page in Defender for IoT on the Azure portal is in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include other legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

The device inventory can be used to view device systems, and network information. The search, filter, edit columns, and export tools can be used to manage this information.

Some of the benefits of the device inventory include:

- Identify all IT, IoT, and OT devices from different inputs. For example, to identify new devices detected in the last day or which devices aren't communicating and might require troubleshooting.

- Group, and filter devices by site, type, or vendor.

- Gain visibility into each device, and investigate the different threats, and alerts for each one.

- Export the entire device inventory to a CSV file for your reports.

## View the device inventory

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Defender for IoT** > **Device inventory**.

## View device information

To view a specific devices information, select the device and the device information window appears.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/device-information-window.png" alt-text="Select a device to see all of that device's information." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/device-information-window.png":::

## Edit device details

As you manage your devices, you may need to update their details, such as to modify security value as assets change, to personalize an inventory so that you can better identify specific devices, or if a device was classified incorrectly.

You can edit device details for each device, one at a time, or select multiple devices to edit details together.

**To edit details for a single device**:

1. In the **Device inventory** page, select the device you want to edit, and then select **Edit** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/edit-device-details.png" border="false"::: in the toolbar at the top of the page.

    The **Edit** pane opens at the right.

1. Modify any of the field values as needed. For more information, see [Reference of editable fields](#reference-of-editable-fields).

1. Select **Save** when you're finished editing the device details.

**To edit details for multiple devices simultaneously**:

1. In the **Device inventory** page, select the devices you want to edit, and then select **Edit** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/edit-device-details.png" border="false"::: in the toolbar at the top of the page.

    The **Edit** pane opens at the right.

1. Select **Add field type**, and then select one or more fields to edit.

1. Update your field definitions as needed, and then select **Save**. For more information, see [Reference of editable fields](#reference-of-editable-fields).

Your updates are saved for all selected devices.

## How to identify devices that haven't recently communicated with the Azure cloud

If you are under the impression that certain devices aren't actively communicating, there's a way to check, and see which devices haven't communicated in a specified time period.

**To identify all devices that have not communicated recently**:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Defender for IoT** > **Device inventory**.

1. Select **Edit columns** > **Add column** > **Last Activity** > **Save**.

1. On the main Device inventory page, select **Last activity** to sort the page by last activity.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/last-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the device inventory organized by last activity." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/last-activity.png":::

1. Select **Add filter** to add a filter on the last activity column.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/last-activity-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add filter screen where you can select the time period to see the last activity.":::

1. Enter a time period, or a custom date range, and select **Apply**.

## Delete a device

If you have devices no longer in use, delete them from the device inventory so that they're no longer connected to Defender for IoT.

Devices must be inactive for 14 days or more in order for you to be able to delete them.

**To delete a device**:

In the **Device inventory** page, select the device you want to delete, and then select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/delete-device.png" border="false"::: in the toolbar at the top of the page.

If your device has had activity in the past 14 days, it isn't considered inactive, and the **Delete** button will be grayed-out.

At the prompt, select **Yes** to confirm that you want to delete the device from Defender for IoT.
