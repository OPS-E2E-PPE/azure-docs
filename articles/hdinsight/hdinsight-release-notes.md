* **Ambari** user auto UI logout due to inactivity. For more information, see [here](./ambari-web-ui-auto-logout.md)
* **Spark** - A new and optimized version of Spark 3.1.3 is included in this release. We tested Apache Spark 3.1.2(previous version) and Apache Spark 3.1.3(current version) using the TPC-DS benchmark. The test was carried out using E8 V3  SKU, for Apache Spark on 1-TB workload. Apache Spark 3.1.3 (current version) outperformed Apache Spark 3.1.2 (previous version) by over 40% in total query runtime for TPC-DS queries using the same hardware specs. The Microsoft Spark team added optimizations available in Azure Synapse with Azure HDInsight.
