## HDInsight version 5.0

Starting from June 1, 2022, we have started rolling out a new version of HDInsight 5.0, this version is backward compatible with HDInsight 4.0. All new open-source releases will be added as incremental releases on HDInsight 5.0.


### Spark

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-release-notes/spark-3-1-for-hdi-5-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Spark 3.1 for HDI 5.1":::

> [!NOTE]
> * If you are using Azure User Interface to create a Spark Cluster for HDInsight, you will see from the dropdown list an additional version Spark 3.1.(HDI 5.0) along with the older versions. This version is a renamed version of Spark 3.1.(HDI 4.0) and it is backward compatible.  
> * This is only a UI level change, which doesnâ€™t impact anything for the existing users and users who are already using the ARM template to build their clusters.
> * For backward compatibility, ARM supports creating Spark 3.1 with HDI 4.0 and 5.0 versions which maps to same versions Spark 3.1 (HDI 5.0)
> * Spark 3.1 (HDI 5.0) cluster comes with HWC 2.0 which works well together with Interactive Query (HDI 5.0) cluster.

### Interactive Query

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-release-notes/interactive-query-3-1-for-hdi-5-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of interactive query 3.1 for HDI 5.1":::

> [!NOTE]
> * If you are creating an Interactive Query Cluster, you will see from the dropdown list another version as Interactive Query 3.1 (HDI 5.0).
> * If you are going to use Spark 3.1 version along with Hive which require ACID support via Hive Warehouse Connector (HWC). You need to select this version Interactive Query 3.1 (HDI 5.0).

### Kafka 

Current ARM template supports HDI 5.0 for Kafka 2.4.1

`HDI Version '5.0' is supported for clusterType "Kafka" and component Version '2.4'.`

We have fixed the arm templated issue.

### Upcoming version upgrades. 
HDInsight team is working on upgrading other open-source components.

1. Spark 3.2.0
1. Kafka 3.2.1
1. HBase 2.4.11
