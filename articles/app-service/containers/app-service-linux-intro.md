# Introduction to Azure Web App for Containers

[Web App](../app-service-web-overview.md) is a fully managed compute platform that is optimized for hosting websites and web applications. Customers can use Web App for Containers to host web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks. The following sections lists the application stacks that are currently supported.

## Languages

|Node.js|PHP|.NET Core|Ruby|
|:------------------:|:---:|:---------:|:----:|
|4.4, 4.5|5.6|1.0-1.1|2.3|
|6.2, 6.6, 6.9-6.11|7.0|||
|8.0-8.1||||

## Deployments

* FTP
* Local Git
* GitHub
* Bitbucket

## DevOps

* Staging environments
* [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) and DockerHub CI/CD

## Console, Publishing, and Debugging

* Environments
* Deployments
* Basic console
* SSH

## Scaling

* Customers can scale web apps up and down by changing the tier of their [App Service plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview?toc=%2fazure%2fapp-service-web%2ftoc.json)

## Locations

Check the [Azure Status Dashboard](https://azure.microsoft.com/status).

## Limitations

The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Web App for Containers. As we enable more features, they will become visible on the portal.

Some features, such as virtual network integration, Azure Active Directory/third-party authentication, or Kudu site extensions, are not available yet. Once these features are available, we will update our documentation and blog about the changes.

Web App for Containers is only supported with [Basic and Standard](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/plans/) app service plans and does not have a [Free or Shared](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/plans/) tier. The following are also important restrictions for Web App for Containers:

* You cannot create Web App for Containers in an App Service plan already hosting non-Linux Web Apps.
* When creating Web App for Containers in a resource group containing non-Linux Web Apps, you must create an App Service plan in a different region than the existing App Service plan.

## Troubleshooting

When your application fails to start or you want to check the logging from your app, check the Docker logs in the LogFiles directory. You can access this directory either through your SCM site or via FTP.
To log the `stdout` and `stderr` from your container, you need to enable **Docker Container logging** under **Diagnostics Logs**.

![Enabling Logging][2]

![Using Kudu to view Docker logs][1]

You can access the SCM site from **Advanced Tools** in the **Development Tools** menu.
