Azure CLI has a command `az webapp up` that will create the necessary resources and deploy your application in a single step. You don't need to create the resources separately so you can move on to [**Step 3 - Deploy your application code to Azure**](#3---deploy-your-application-code-to-azure) and select the _Deploy using Azure CLI_ tab.
