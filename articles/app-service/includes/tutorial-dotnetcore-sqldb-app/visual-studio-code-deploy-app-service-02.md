1. Select the Azure icon on the left navigation and expand the subscriptions to find the **coreSqlXYZ** App Service you created previously.

1. Right-click on the **App Service** node and select **Deploy to Web App**.

1. A prompt will appear to select the folder to deploy.  If root of the project is already suggested, choose that option, otherwise select the **Browse** button to select the root folder from the file explorer.

When the deployment completes, you should see a VS Code notification prompting you to browse to the deployed app.
