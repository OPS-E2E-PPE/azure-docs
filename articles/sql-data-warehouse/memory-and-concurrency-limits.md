# Memory and concurrency limits for Azure SQL Data Warehouse
View the memory and concurrency limits allocated to the various performance levels and resource classes in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. For more information, and to apply these capabilities to your workload management plan, see [Resource classes for workload management](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md). 

## Performance tiers

SQL Data Warehouse offers two performance tiers that are optimized for analytical workloads. A performance tier is an option that determines the configuration of your data warehouse. This option is one of the first choices you make when creating a data warehouse.

- The **Optimized for Elasticity performance tier** separates the compute and storage layers in the architecture. This option excels on workloads that can take full advantage of the separation between compute and storage by scaling frequently to support short periods of peak activity. This compute tier has the lowest entry price point and scales to support the majority of customer workloads.

- The **Optimized for Compute performance tier** uses the latest Azure hardware to introduce a new NVMe Solid State Disk cache that keeps the most frequently accessed data close to the CPUs, which is exactly where you want it. By automatically tiering the storage, this performance tier excels with complex queries since all IO is kept local to the compute layer. Furthermore, the columnstore is enhanced to store an unlimited amount of data in your SQL Data Warehouse. The Optimized for Compute performance tier provides the greatest level of scalability, enabling you to scale up to 30,000 compute Data Warehouse Units (cDWU). Choose this tier for workloads that requires continuous, blazing fast, performance.

## Data warehouse limits
The following tables show the maximum capacity for the data warehouse at different performance levels. To change the performance level, see [Scale compute - portal](quickstart-scale-compute-portal.md).

### Optimized for Elasticity

The service levels for the Optimized for Elasticity performance tier range from DW100 to DW6000.

### Optimized for Compute

The Optimized for Compute performance tier provides 2.5x more memory per query than the Optimized for Elasticity performance tier. This extra memory helps the Optimized for Compute performance tier deliver its fast performance.  The performance levels for the Optimized for Compute performance tier range from DW1000c to DW30000c. 

| Performance level | Max concurrent queries | Compute nodes | Distributions per Compute node | Max memory per distribution (GB) | Max memory per data warehouse (GB) |

The maximum cDWU is DW30000c, which has 60 Compute nodes and one distribution per Compute node. For example, a 600 TB data warehouse at DW30000c processes approximately 10 TB per Compute node.


## Concurrency maximums
To ensure each query has enough resources to execute efficiently, SQL Data Warehouse tracks compute resource utilization by assigning concurrency slots to each query. The system puts queries into a queue where they wait until enough [concurrency slots](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md#concurrency-slots) are available. 

Concurrency slots also determine CPU prioritization. For more information, see [Analyze your workload](analyze-your-workload.md)

### Optimized for Compute
The following table shows the maximum concurrent queries and concurrency slots for each [dynamic resource class](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md). These apply to the Optimized for Compute performance tier.

When one of these thresholds is met, new queries are queued and executed on a first-in, first-out basis.  As a queries finishes and the number of queries and slots fall below the limits, SQL Data Warehouse releases queued queries.
