# Working with Azure OpenAI models

Azure OpenAI Service is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. [Model availability varies by ](../concepts/models.md).

You can get a list of models that are available for both inference and fine-tuning by your Azure OpenAI resource by using the [Models List API](/rest/api/cognitiveservices/azureopenaistable/models/list).

## Model updates

Azure OpenAI now supports automatic updates for select model deployments. On models where automatic update support is available, a model version drop-down will be visible in Azure OpenAI Studio under **Create new deployment** and **Edit deployment**:

### Auto update to default

When **Auto-update to default** is selected your model deployment will be automatically updated within two weeks of a change in the default version.

If you're still in the early testing phases for inference models, we recommend deploying models with **auto-update to default** set whenever it's available.

### Specific model version

As your use of Azure OpenAI evolves, and you start to build and integrate with applications you may want to manually control model updates so that you can first test and validate that model performance is remaining consistent for your use case prior to upgrade.

When you select a specific model version for a deployment this version will remain selected until you either choose to manually update yourself, or once you reach the retirement date for the model. When the retirement date is reached the model will automatically upgrade to the default version at the time of retirement.

### GPT-35-Turbo 0301 and GPT-4 0314 retirement

The `gpt-35-turbo` (`0301`) and both `gpt-4` (`0314`) models will be retired no earlier than July 5, 2024. Upon retirement, deployments will automatically be upgraded to the default version at the time of retirement. If you would like your deployment to stop accepting completion requests rather than upgrading, then you'll be able to set the model upgrade option to expire through the API.

## Viewing deprecation dates

For currently deployed models, from Azure OpenAI Studio select **Deployments**:

To view deprecation/expiration dates for all available models in a given region from Azure OpenAI Studio select **Models** > **Column options** > Select **Deprecation fine tune** and **Deprecation inference**:

## Model deployment upgrade configuration

There are three distinct model deployment upgrade options which are configurable via REST API:

| Name | Description |
|------|--------|
| `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable` | Once a new version is designated as the default, the model deployment will automatically upgrade to the default version within two weeks of that designation change being made. |
`OnceCurrentVersionExpired` | Once the retirement date is reached the model deployment will automatically upgrade to the current default version. |
`NoAutoUpgrade` | The model deployment will never automatically upgrade. Once the retirement date is reached the model deployment will stop working. You will need to update your code referencing that deployment to point to a non-expired model deployment. |

To query the current model deployment settings including the deployment upgrade configuration for a given resource use [`Deployments List`](/rest/api/cognitiveservices/accountmanagement/deployments/list?tabs=HTTP#code-try-0)  

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{accountName}/deployments?api-version=2023-05-01
```

**Path parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required? |  Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| ```acountname``` | string |  Required | The name of your Azure OpenAI Resource. |
| ```resourceGroupName``` | string |  Required | The name of the associated resource group for this model deployment. |
| ```subscriptionId``` | string |  Required | Subscription ID for the associated subscription. |
| ```api-version``` | string | Required |The API version to use for this operation. This follows the YYYY-MM-DD format. |

**Supported versions**

- `2023-05-01` [Swagger spec](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/1e71ad94aeb8843559d59d863c895770560d7c93/specification/cognitiveservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/stable/2023-05-01/cognitiveservices.json)

### Example response

```json
{
      "id": "/subscriptions/{Subcription-GUID}/resourceGroups/{Resource-Group-Name}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{Resource-Name}/deployments/text-davinci-003",
      "type": "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments",
      "name": "text-davinci-003",
      "sku": {
        "name": "Standard",
        "capacity": 60
      },
      "properties": {
        "model": {
          "format": "OpenAI",
          "name": "text-davinci-003",
          "version": "1"
        },
        "versionUpgradeOption": "OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable",
        "capabilities": {
          "completion": "true",
          "search": "true"
        },
        "raiPolicyName": "Microsoft.Default",
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
        "rateLimits": [
          {
            "key": "request",
            "renewalPeriod": 10,
            "count": 60
          },
          {
            "key": "token",
            "renewalPeriod": 60,
            "count": 60000
          }
        ]
      }
```

You can then take the settings from this list to construct an update model REST API call as described below if you want to modify the deployment upgrade configuration.

## Update & deploy models via the API

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{accountName}/deployments/{deploymentName}?api-version=2023-05-01
```

**Path parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required? |  Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| ```acountname``` | string |  Required | The name of your Azure OpenAI Resource. |
| ```deploymentName``` | string | Required | The deployment name you chose when you deployed an existing model or the name you would like a new model deployment to have.   |
| ```resourceGroupName``` | string |  Required | The name of the associated resource group for this model deployment. |
| ```subscriptionId``` | string |  Required | Subscription ID for the associated subscription. |
| ```api-version``` | string | Required |The API version to use for this operation. This follows the YYYY-MM-DD format. |

**Supported versions**

- `2023-05-01` [Swagger spec](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/1e71ad94aeb8843559d59d863c895770560d7c93/specification/cognitiveservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/stable/2023-05-01/cognitiveservices.json)

**Request body**

This is only a subset of the available request body parameters. For the full list of the parameters, you can refer to the [REST API reference documentation](/rest/api/cognitiveservices/accountmanagement/deployments/create-or-update).

|Parameter|Type| Description |
|--|--|--|
|versionUpgradeOption | String | Deployment model version upgrade options:<br>`OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`<br>`OnceCurrentVersionExpired`<br>`NoAutoUpgrade`|
|capacity|integer|This represents the amount of [quota](../how-to/quota.md) you are assigning to this deployment. A value of 1 equals 1,000 Tokens per Minute (TPM)|

#### Example request

```Bash
curl -X PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resource-group-temp/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/docs-openai-test-001/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002-test-1?api-version=2023-05-01 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"sku":{"name":"Standard","capacity":1},"properties": {"model": {"format": "OpenAI","name": "text-embedding-ada-002","version": "2"},"versionUpgradeOption":"OnceCurrentVersionExpired"}}'
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are multiple ways to generate an authorization token. The easiest method for initial testing is to launch the Cloud Shell from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Then run [`az account get-access-token`](/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-account-get-access-token&preserve-view=true). You can use this token as your temporary authorization token for API testing.
