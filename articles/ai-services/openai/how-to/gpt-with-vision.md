# Use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision


GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is a large multimodal model (LMM) developed by OpenAI that can analyze images and provide textual responses to questions about them. It incorporates both natural language processing and visual understanding.

The GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model answers general questions about what's present in the images. You can also show it video if you use [Vision enhancement](#use-vision-enhancement-with-video).

> [!TIP]
> To use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, you call the Chat Completion API on a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model that you have deployed. If you're not familiar with the Chat Completion API, see the [GPT-4 Turbo & GPT-4 how-to guide](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt?tabs=python&pivots=programming-language-chat-completions).

## Call the Chat Completion APIs

The following REST command shows the most basic way to use the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model with code. If this is your first time using these models programmatically, we recommend starting with our [GPT-4 Turbo with Vision quickstart](../gpt-v-quickstart.md). 

Send a POST request to `https://{RESOURCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/chat/completions?api-version=2023-12-01-preview` where 

- RESOURCE_NAME is the name of your Azure OpenAI resource 
- DEPLOYMENT_NAME is the name of your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployment 

**Required headers**: 
- `Content-Type`: application/json 
- `api-key`: {API_KEY} 

**Body**: 
The following is a sample request body. The format is the same as the chat completions API for GPT-4, except that the message content can be an array containing strings and images (either a URL to an image, or a base-64-encoded image). 

```json
{
    "messages": [ 
        {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant." 
        },
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": [ 
                "Describe this picture:", { "image": "URL or base-64-encoded image" } 
            ] 
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100, 
    "stream": false 
} 
```

## Use Vision enhancement with images

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision provides exclusive access to Azure AI Services tailored enhancements. When combined with Azure AI Vision, it enhances your chat experience by providing the chat model with more detailed information about visible text in the image and the locations of objects.

The **Optical character recognition (OCR)** integration allows the model to produce higher quality responses for dense text, transformed images, and number-heavy financial documents. It also covers a wider range of languages.

The **object grounding** integration brings a new layer to data analysis and user interaction, as the feature can visually distinguish and highlight important elements in the images it processes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use Vision enhancement, you need a Computer Vision resource, and it must be in the same Azure region as your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision resource.

> [!CAUTION]
> Azure AI enhancements for GPT-4 Turbo with Vision will be billed separately from the core functionalities. Each specific Azure AI enhancement for GPT-4 Turbo with Vision has its own distinct charges.

Send a POST request to `https://{RESOURCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/extensions/chat/completions?api-version=2023-12-01-preview` where 

- RESOURCE_NAME is the name of your Azure OpenAI resource 
- DEPLOYMENT_NAME is the name of your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployment 

**Required headers**: 
- `Content-Type`: application/json 
- `api-key`: {API_KEY} 

**Body**: 

The request body is the same as above, except you must include the `enhancements` and `dataSources` objects. `enhancements` represents the specific Vision enhancement features requested in the chat. It has a `grounding` and `ocr` property, which each have a boolean `enabled` property. Use these to request the OCR service and/or the object detection/grounding service. `dataSources` represents the Computer Vision resource data that's needed for Vision enhancement. It has a `type` property which should be `"AzureComputerVision"` and a `parameters` property. Set the `endpoint` and `key` to the endpoint URL and access key of your Computer Vision resource.

```json
{
    "enhancements": {
            "ocr": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            "grounding": {
              "enabled": true
            }
    },
    "dataSources": [
    {
        "type": "AzureComputerVision",
        "parameters": {
            "endpoint": "<your_computer_vision_endpoint>",
            "key": "<your_computer_vision_key>"
        }
    }],
    "messages": [ 
        {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant." 
        },
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": [ 
                "Describe this picture:", { "image": "URL or base-64-encoded image" } 
            ] 
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100, 
    "stream": false 
} 
```

The chat responses you receive from the model should now include enhanced information about the image, such as object labels and bounding boxes, and OCR results.

## Use Vision enhancement with video

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision provides exclusive access to Azure AI Services tailored enhancements. The **video prompt** integration uses Azure AI Vision video retrieval to sample a set of frames from a video and create a transcript of the speech in the video. It enables the AI model to give summaries and answers about video content.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use Vision enhancement, you need a Computer Vision resource, and it must be in the same Azure region as your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision resource.

> [!CAUTION]
> Azure AI enhancements for GPT-4 Turbo with Vision will be billed separately from the core functionalities. Each specific Azure AI enhancement for GPT-4 Turbo with Vision has its own distinct charges.

Follow these steps to set up a video retrieval system and integrate it with your AI chat model:
1. Get an Azure AI Vision resource in the same region as the Azure OpenAI resource you're using.
1. Follow the instructions in  [Do video retrieval using vectorization](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/video-retrieval) to create a video retrieval index. Return to this guide once your index is created.
1. Save the index name, the `documentId` values of your videos, and the blob storage SAS URLs of your videos to a temporary location. You'll need these values the next steps.
1. Prepare a POST request to `https://{RESOURCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/extensions/chat/completions?api-version=2023-12-01-preview` where 

    - RESOURCE_NAME is the name of your Azure OpenAI resource 
    - DEPLOYMENT_NAME is the name of your GPT-4 Vision model deployment 
        
    **Required headers**: 
    - `Content-Type`: application/json 
    - `api-key`: {API_KEY} 
1. Add the following JSON structure in the request body:
    ```json
    {
        "enhancements": {
                "video": {
                  "enabled": true
                }
        },
        "dataSources": [
        {
            "type": "AzureComputerVisionVideoIndex",
            "parameters": {
                "endpoint": "<your_computer_vision_endpoint>",
                "key": "<your_computer_vision_key>",
                "computerVisionBaseUrl": "<your_computer_vision_endpoint>",
                "computerVisionApiKey": "<your_computer_vision_key>",
                "indexName": "<name_of_your_index>",
                "videoUrls": ["<your_video_SAS_URL>"]
            }
        }],
        "messages": [ 
            {
                "role": "system", 
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant." 
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "text",
                            "text": "Describe this video:"
                        }
                    ]
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "acv_document_id",
                            "acv_document_id": "<your_video_ID>"
                        }
                    ]
            }
        ]
    } 
    ```

    The request includes the `enhancements` and `dataSources` objects. `enhancements` represents the specific Vision enhancement features requested in the chat. `dataSources` represents the Computer Vision resource data that's needed for Vision enhancement. It has a `type` property which should be `"AzureComputerVisionVideoIndex"` and a `parameters` property which contains your AI Vision and video information.
1. Fill in all the `<placeholder>` fields above with your own information: enter the endpoint URLs and keys of your OpenAI and AI Vision resources where appropriate, and retrieve the video index information from the earlier step.
1. Send the POST request to the API endpoint. It should contain your OpenAI and AI Vision credentials, the name of your video index, and the ID and SAS URL of a single video.

 ## Low or high fidelity image understanding

By controlling the _detail_ parameter, which has two options, `low` or `high`, you can control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding.
- `low` disables the "high res" mode. The model receives a low-res 512x512 version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens for use cases that don't require high detail.
- `high` enables "high res" mode, which first allows the model to see the low res image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512x512 squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens.

## Limitations

### Image support

- **Limitation on image enhancements per chat session**: Enhancements cannot be applied to multiple images within a single chat call.
- **Maximum input image size**: The maximum size for input images is restricted to 4 MB.
- **Object grounding in enhancement API**: When the enhancement API is used for object grounding, and the model detects duplicates of an object, it will generate one bounding box and label for all the duplicates instead of separate ones for each.
- **Low resolution accuracy**: When images are analyzed using the "low resolution" setting, it allows for faster responses and uses fewer input tokens for certain use cases. However, this could impact the accuracy of object and text recognition within the image.
- **Image chat restriction**: When uploading images in the chat playground or the API, there is a limit of 10 images per chat call.

### Video support

- **Low resolution**: Video frames are analyzed using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision's "low resolution" setting, which may affect the accuracy of small object and text recognition in the video.
- **Video file limits**: Both MP4 and MOV file types are supported. In the Azure AI Playground, videos must be less than 3 minutes long. When you use the API there is no such limitation.
- **Prompt limits**: Video prompts only contain one video and no images. In Playground, you can clear the session to try another video or images.
- **Limited frame selection**: The service selects 20 frames from the entire video, which might not capture all the critical moments or details. Frame selection can be approximately evenly spread through the video or focused by a specific video retrieval query, depending on the prompt.
- **Language support**: The service primarily supports English for grounding with transcripts. Transcripts don't provide accurate information on lyrics in songs.
