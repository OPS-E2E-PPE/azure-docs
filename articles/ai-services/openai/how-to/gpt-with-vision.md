# Use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision


GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is a large multimodal model (LMM) developed by OpenAI that can analyze images and provide textual responses to questions about them. It incorporates both natural language processing and visual understanding.

The GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model answers general questions about what's present in the images. You can also show it video if you use [Vision enhancement](#use-vision-enhancement-with-video).

> [!TIP]
> To use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, you call the Chat Completion API on a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model that you have deployed. If you're not familiar with the Chat Completion API, see the [GPT-4 Turbo & GPT-4 how-to guide](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt?tabs=python&pivots=programming-language-chat-completions).

## Call the Chat Completion APIs

The following REST command shows the most basic way to use the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model with code. If this is your first time using these models programmatically, we recommend starting with our [GPT-4 Turbo with Vision quickstart](../gpt-v-quickstart.md). 

Send a POST request to `https://{RESOURCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/chat/completions?api-version=2023-12-01-preview` where 

- RESOURCE_NAME is the name of your Azure OpenAI resource 
- DEPLOYMENT_NAME is the name of your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployment 

**Required headers**: 
- `Content-Type`: application/json 
- `api-key`: {API_KEY} 

**Body**: 
The following is a sample request body. The format is the same as the chat completions API for GPT-4, except that the message content can be an array containing strings and images (either a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL to an image, or a base-64-encoded image). Remember to set a `"max_tokens"` value, or the return output will be cut off.

```json
{
    "messages": [ 
        {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant." 
        },
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": [
	            {
	                "type": "text",

    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 1156,
        "completion_tokens": 80,
        "total_tokens": 1236
    }
}
```

Every response includes a `"finish_details"` field. The subfield `"type"` has the following possible values:
- `stop`: API returned complete model output.
- `max_tokens`: Incomplete model output due to the `max_tokens` input parameter or model's token limit.
- `content_filter`: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters.

If `finish_details.type` is `stop`, then there is another `"stop"` property that specifies the token that caused the output to end.

## Detail parameter settings in image processing: Low, High, Auto  

The detail parameter in the model offers three choices: `low`, `high`, or `auto`, to adjust the way the model interprets and processes images. The default setting is auto, where the model decides between low or high based on the size of the image input. 
- `low` setting: the model does not activate the "high res" mode, instead processes a lower resolution 512x512 version, resulting in quicker responses and reduced token consumption for scenarios where fine detail isn't crucial.
- `high` setting: the model activates "high res" mode. Here, the model initially views the low-resolution image and then generates detailed 512x512 segments from the input image. Each segment uses double the token budget, allowing for a more detailed interpretation of the image.''

For details on how the image parameters impact tokens used and pricing please see - [What is OpenAI? Image Tokens with GPT-4 Turbo with Vision](../overview.md#image-tokens-gpt-4-turbo-with-vision)

## Use Vision enhancement with images

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision provides exclusive access to Azure AI Services tailored enhancements. When combined with Azure AI Vision, it enhances your chat experience by providing the chat model with more detailed information about visible text in the image and the locations of objects.

The **Optical character recognition (OCR)** integration allows the model to produce higher quality responses for dense text, transformed images, and number-heavy financial documents. It also covers a wider range of languages.

The **object grounding** integration brings a new layer to data analysis and user interaction, as the feature can visually distinguish and highlight important elements in the images it processes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use Vision enhancement, you need a Computer Vision resource, and it must be in the same Azure region as your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision resource.

> [!CAUTION]
> Azure AI enhancements for GPT-4 Turbo with Vision will be billed separately from the core functionalities. Each specific Azure AI enhancement for GPT-4 Turbo with Vision has its own distinct charges.

Send a POST request to `https://{RESOURCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/extensions/chat/completions?api-version=2023-12-01-preview` where 

- RESOURCE_NAME is the name of your Azure OpenAI resource 
- DEPLOYMENT_NAME is the name of your GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployment 

**Required headers**: 
- `Content-Type`: application/json 
- `api-key`: {API_KEY} 

**Body**: 

The format is similar to that of the chat completions API for GPT-4, but the message content can be an array containing strings and images (either a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL to an image, or a base-64-encoded image).

You must also include the `enhancements` and `dataSources` objects. `enhancements` represents the specific Vision enhancement features requested in the chat. It has a `grounding` and `ocr` property, which each have a boolean `enabled` property. Use these to request the OCR service and/or the object detection/grounding service. `dataSources` represents the Computer Vision resource data that's needed for Vision enhancement. It has a `type` property which should be `"AzureComputerVision"` and a `parameters` property. Set the `endpoint` and `key` to the endpoint URL and access key of your Computer Vision resource. Remember to set a `"max_tokens"` value, or the return output will be cut off.

```json
{
    "enhancements": {
            "ocr": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            "grounding": {
              "enabled": true
            }
    },
    "dataSources": [
    {
        "type": "AzureComputerVision",
        "parameters": {
            "endpoint": "<your_computer_vision_endpoint>",
            "key": "<your_computer_vision_key>"
        }
    }],
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
	            {
	                "type": "text",
	                "text": "Describe this picture:"
	            },
	            {
	                "type": "image_url",
	                "image_url": {
                        "url":"<URL or base-64-encoded image>" 
                    }
                }
           ] 
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100, 
    "stream": false 
} 
```

Processing videos will involve the use of extra tokens to identify key frames for analysis. The number of these additional tokens will be roughly equivalent to the sum of the tokens in the text input plus 700 tokens.

#### Calculation
For a typical use case let's imagine that I have use a 3-minute video with a 100-token prompt input. The section of video has a transcript that's 100-tokens long and when I process the prompt, I generate 100-tokens of output. The pricing for this transaction would be as follows:

| Item                                      | Detail                                                        | Total Cost   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| GPT-4 Turbo with Vision Input Tokens      | 100 text tokens                                               | $0.001       |
| Additional Cost to identify frames        | 100 input tokens + 700 tokens + 1 Video Retrieval txn         | $0.00825     |
| Image Inputs and Transcript Input         | 20 images (85 tokens each) + 100 transcript tokens            | $0.018       |
| Output Tokens                             | 100 tokens (assumed)                                          | $0.003       |
| **Total Cost**                            |                                                               | **$0.03025** |

Additionally, there's a one-time indexing cost of $0.15 to generate the Video Retrieval index for this 3-minute segment of video. This index can be reused across any number of Video Retrieval and GPT-4 Turbo with Vision calls.

## Limitations

### Image support

- **Limitation on image enhancements per chat session**: Enhancements cannot be applied to multiple images within a single chat call.
- **Maximum input image size**: The maximum size for input images is restricted to 20 MB.
- **Object grounding in enhancement API**: When the enhancement API is used for object grounding, and the model detects duplicates of an object, it will generate one bounding box and label for all the duplicates instead of separate ones for each.
- **Low resolution accuracy**: When images are analyzed using the "low resolution" setting, it allows for faster responses and uses fewer input tokens for certain use cases. However, this could impact the accuracy of object and text recognition within the image.
- **Image chat restriction**: When uploading images in the chat playground or the API, there is a limit of 10 images per chat call.

### Video support

- **Low resolution**: Video frames are analyzed using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision's "low resolution" setting, which may affect the accuracy of small object and text recognition in the video.
- **Video file limits**: Both MP4 and MOV file types are supported. In the Azure AI Playground, videos must be less than 3 minutes long. When you use the API there is no such limitation.
- **Prompt limits**: Video prompts only contain one video and no images. In Playground, you can clear the session to try another video or images.
- **Limited frame selection**: The service selects 20 frames from the entire video, which might not capture all the critical moments or details. Frame selection can be approximately evenly spread through the video or focused by a specific video retrieval query, depending on the prompt.
- **Language support**: The service primarily supports English for grounding with transcripts. Transcripts don't provide accurate information on lyrics in songs.
