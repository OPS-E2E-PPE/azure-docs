# Use CLI to configure active geo-replication for a single database in Azure SQL Database

This Azure CLI script example configures active geo-replication for a single database and fails it over to a secondary replica of the database.

If you choose to install and use Azure CLI locally, this article requires that you are running Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running Bash on Windows, run this script from within a Docker container.

## Sample script

### Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

When Cloud Shell opens, verify that **Bash** is selected for your environment. Subsequent sessions will use Azure CLI in a Bash environment, Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press **Enter** to run it.

### Sign in to Azure

Cloud Shell is automatically authenticated under the initial account signed-in with. Use the following script to sign in using a different subscription, replacing `<Subscription ID>` with your Azure Subscription ID.  [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
subscription="<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

For more information, see [set active subscription](/cli/azure/account#az_account_set) or [log in interactively](/cli/azure/reference-index#az_login)

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/sql-database/setup-geodr-and-failover/setup-geodr-and-failover-single-database.sh" range="4-46":::

### Clean up resources

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it using the [az group delete](/cli/azure/vm/extension#az_vm_extension_set) command- unless you have additional needs for these resources. Some of these resources may take a while to create, as well as to delete.

```azurecli
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
