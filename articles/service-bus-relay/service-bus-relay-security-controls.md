# Security controls for Azure Service Bus Relay

This article documents the security controls built into Azure Service Bus Relay.

[!INCLUDE [Security controls Header](../../includes/security-controls-header.md)]

## Network

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Service endpoint support| No |  |
| Network isolation and firewalling support| No |  |
| Forced tunneling support| N/A | Relay is the TLS tunnel  |

## Monitoring & logging

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Azure monitoring support (Log analytics, App insights, etc.)| Yes | |
| Control and management plane logging and audit| Yes | Through [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/index.yml). |
| Data plane logging and audit| Yes | Connection success / failure and errors and logged.  |

## Identity

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Authentication| Yes | Via SAS. |
| Authorization|  Yes | Via SAS. |

## Data protection

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|--|
| Server-side encryption at rest: Microsoft-managed keys |  N/A | Relay is a web socket and does not persist data. |
| Server-side encryption at rest: customer-managed keys (BYOK) | No | Uses Microsoft TLS certs only.  |
| Column level encryption (Azure Data Services)| N/A | |
| Encryption in transit (such as ExpressRoute encryption, in VNet encryption, and VNet-VNet encryption)| Yes | Service requires TLS. |
| API calls encrypted| Yes | HTTPS. |


## Configuration management

| Security control | Yes/No | Notes|
|---|---|--|
| Configuration management support (versioning of configuration, etc.)| Yes | Through [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/index.yml).|
