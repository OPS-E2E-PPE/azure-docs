# Train ML models with MLflow Projects and Azure Machine Learning (Preview)

In this article, learn how to enable MLflow's tracking URI and logging API, collectively known as [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html#using-the-tracking-api), to submit training jobs with [MLflow Projects](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) and Azure Machine Learning backend support. You can submit jobs locally with Azure Machine Learning tracking or migrate your runs to the cloud like via an [Azure Machine Learning Compute](./how-to-create-attach-compute-cluster.md).

[MLflow Projects](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) allow for you to organize and describe your code to let other data scientists (or automated tools) run it. MLflow Projects with Azure Machine Learning enable you to track and manage your training runs in your workspace.

[MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org) is an open-source library for managing the life cycle of your machine learning experiments. MLFlow Tracking is a component of MLflow that logs and tracks your training run metrics and model artifacts, no matter your experiment's environment--locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, a virtual machine, or an [Azure Databricks cluster](how-to-use-mlflow-azure-databricks.md).

[Learn more about the MLflow and Azure Machine Learning integration.](how-to-use-mlflow.md).

> [!TIP]
> The information in this document is primarily for data scientists and developers who want to monitor the model training process. If you are an administrator interested in monitoring resource usage and events from Azure Machine Learning, such as quotas, completed training runs, or completed model deployments, see [Monitoring Azure Machine Learning](monitor-azure-machine-learning.md).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [mlflow-prereqs](../../includes/machine-learning-mlflow-prereqs.md)]

### Connect to your workspace

First, let's connect MLflow to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

# [Azure Machine Learning compute](#tab/aml)

Tracking is already configured for you. Your default credentials will also be used when working with MLflow.

# [Remote compute](#tab/remote)

**Configure tracking URI**

[!INCLUDE [configure-mlflow-tracking](../../includes/machine-learning-mlflow-configure-tracking.md)]

**Configure authentication**

Once the tracking is configured, you'll also need to configure how the authentication needs to happen to the associated workspace. By default, the Azure Machine Learning plugin for MLflow will perform interactive authentication by opening the default browser to prompt for credentials. Refer to [Configure MLflow for Azure Machine Learning: Configure authentication](how-to-use-mlflow-configure-tracking.md#configure-authentication) to additional ways to configure authentication for MLflow in Azure Machine Learning workspaces.

[!INCLUDE [configure-mlflow-auth](../../includes/machine-learning-mlflow-configure-auth.md)]

## Train MLflow Projects on local compute

This example shows how to submit MLflow projects locally with Azure Machine Learning.

Create the backend configuration object to store necessary information for the integration such as, the compute target and which type of managed environment to use.

```python
backend_config = {"USE_CONDA": False}
```

Add the `azureml-mlflow` package as a pip dependency to your environment configuration file in order to track metrics and key artifacts in your workspace. 

``` shell
name: mlflow-example
channels:
  - defaults
  - anaconda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.6
  - scikit-learn=0.19.1
  - pip
  - pip:
    - mlflow
    - azureml-mlflow
```

Submit the local run and ensure you set the parameter `backend = "azureml" `. With this setting, you can submit runs locally and get the added support of automatic output tracking, log files, snapshots, and printed errors in your workspace.

View your runs and metrics in the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

```python
local_env_run = mlflow.projects.run(uri=".", 
                                    parameters={"alpha":0.3},
                                    backend = "azureml",
                                    use_conda=False,
                                    backend_config = backend_config, 
                                    )

```

## Train MLflow projects with remote compute

This example shows how to submit MLflow projects on a remote compute with Azure Machine Learning tracking.

Create the backend configuration object to store necessary information for the integration such as, the compute target and which type of managed environment to use.

The integration accepts "COMPUTE" and "USE_CONDA" as parameters where "COMPUTE" is set to the name of your remote compute cluster and "USE_CONDA" which creates a new environment for the project from the environment configuration file. If "COMPUTE" is present in the object, the project will be automatically submitted to the remote compute and ignore "USE_CONDA". MLflow accepts a dictionary object or a JSON file.

```python
# dictionary
backend_config = {"COMPUTE": "cpu-cluster", "USE_CONDA": False}
```

Add the `azureml-mlflow` package as a pip dependency to your environment configuration file in order to track metrics and key artifacts in your workspace. 

``` shell
name: mlflow-example
channels:
  - defaults
  - anaconda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.6
  - scikit-learn=0.19.1
  - pip
  - pip:
    - mlflow
    - azureml-mlflow
```

Submit the mlflow project run and ensure you set the parameter `backend = "azureml" `. With this setting, you can submit your run to your remote compute and get the added support of automatic output tracking, log files, snapshots, and printed errors in your workspace.

View your runs and metrics in the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

```python
remote_mlflow_run = mlflow.projects.run(uri=".", 
                                    parameters={"alpha":0.3},
                                    backend = "azureml",
                                    backend_config = backend_config, 
                                    )

```


## Clean up resources

If you don't plan to use the logged metrics and artifacts in your workspace, the ability to delete them individually is currently unavailable. Instead, delete the resource group that contains the storage account and workspace, so you don't incur any charges:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-mlflow-azure-databricks/delete-resources.png" alt-text="Image showing how to delete an Azure resource group.":::    

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter the resource group name. Then select **Delete**.
