## Set up authentication with Azure and DevOps

Before you can set up an MLOps project with Azure Machine Learning, you need to set up authentication for Azure DevOps.

### Create service principal
   For the use of the demo, the creation of one or two service principles is required, depending on how many environments, you want to work on (Dev or Prod or Both). These principles can be created using one of the following methods:

# [Create from Azure Cloud Shell](#tab/azure-shell)

1. Launch the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

    > [!TIP]
    > The first time you've launched the Cloud Shell, you'll be prompted to create a storage account for the Cloud Shell.

1. If prompted, choose **Bash** as the environment used in the Cloud Shell. You can also change environments in the drop-down on the top navigation bar

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/power-shell-cli.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the cloud shell environment dropdown." lightbox = "./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/power-shell-cli.png" :::

1. Copy the following bash commands to your computer and update the** projectName**,** subscriptionID**, and **environment variables** with the values for your project. If you're creating both a Dev and Prod environment, you'll need to run this script once for each environment, creating a service principal for each. This command will also grant the **Contributor** role to the service principal in the subscription provided. This is required for Azure DevOps to properly use resources in that subscription.
     ``` bash
        projectName="<your project name>"
        roleName="Contributor"
        subscriptionId="<subscription Id>"
        environment="<Dev|Prod>" #First letter should be capitalized
        servicePrincipalName="Azure-ARM-${environment}-${projectName}"
        # Verify the ID of the active subscription
        echo "Using subscription ID $subscriptionID"
        echo "Creating SP for RBAC with name $servicePrincipalName, with role $roleName and in scopes     /subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $servicePrincipalName --role $roleName --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
        echo "Please ensure that the information created here is properly save for future use."
     ```

1. Copy your edited commands into the Azure Shell and run them (Ctrl + Shift + v).

1. After running these commands, you'll be presented with information related to the service principal. Save this information to a safe location, it will be use later in the demo to configure Azure DevOps.
    
     ```json
     {
       "appId": "<application id>",
       "displayName": "Azure-ARM-dev-Sample_Project_Name",
       "password": "<password>",
       "tenant": "<tenant id>"
     }
     ```

1. Repeat **Step 3** if you're creating service principals for Dev and Prod environments. For this demo, we'll be creating only one environment, which is Prod.

1. Close the Cloud Shell once the service principals are created.

# [Create from Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to [Azure App Registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType~/null/sourceTypeMicrosoft_AAD_IAM).

1. Select **New Registration**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/service-principle-set-up-ownership-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of service principal setup." lightbox = "./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/service-principle-set-up-ownership-tab.png":::

1. Go through the process of creating a Service Principle (SP) selecting **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant)** and name it **Azure-ARM-Dev-ProjectName**. Once created, repeat and create a new SP named **Azure-ARM-Prod-ProjectName**. Replace **ProjectName** with the name of your project so that the service principal can be uniquely identified.

1. Go to **Certificates & Secrets** and add for each SP **New client secret**, then store the value and secret separately.

1. To assign the necessary permissions to these principals, select your respective [subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_BillingSubscriptionsBlade?) and go to IAM. Select **+Add** then select **Add Role Assignment**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/service-principle-set-up-iam-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add role assignment page." lightbox = "./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/service-principle-set-up-iam-tab.png":::

1. Select Contributor and add members selecting + Select Members. Add the member **Azure-ARM-Dev-ProjectName** as create before.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/service-principle-set-up-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add role assignment selection." lightbox = "./media/how-to-end-to-end-azure-devops-with-prompt-flow/service-principle-set-up-role-assignment.png":::

### Set up connections for prompt flow

Connection helps securely store and manage secret keys or other sensitive credentials required for interacting with LLM and other external tools, for example, Azure Content Safety.

Go to workspace portal, select `Prompt flow` -> `Connections` -> `Create` -> `Azure OpenAI`, then follow the instruction to create your own connections. To learn more, see [connections](../prompt-flow/concept-connections.md).

### Set up runtime for prompt flow

Prompt flow's runtime provides the computing resources required for the application to run, including a Docker image that contains all necessary dependency packages.

In this guide, we will use a runtime to run your prompt flow. You need to create your own [prompt flow runtime](../prompt-flow/how-to-create-manage-runtime.md).

Go to workspace portal, select `Prompt flow` -> `Runtime` -> `Add`, then follow the instruction to create your own connections.
