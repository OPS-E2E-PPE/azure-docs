# Executing data sources and data preparation packages from Python

To use a data source or data preparation package within Python:
- Navigate to the Data tab of your project.
- Right-click on the appropriate source.
- Choose "Generate Data Access Code File."

This action creates a short Python script that executes the package and returns a dataframe.

## Data sources

The `azureml.dataprep.datasource` module contains a single function to execute a data source and return a dataframe: `load_datasource(path, secrets=None, spark=None)`.
- `path` is the path to the data source (.dsource file).
- `secrets` is an optional dict mapping keys to secrets.
- `spark` is an optional bool specifying whether to return a Spark dataframe or a Pandas dataframe. By default, Azure ML Workbench determines which kind of dataframe to return at runtime based on context.

## Data preparation packages

The `azureml.dataprep.package` module contains three functions that execute a dataflow from a data preparation package.

### Execution functions

- `submit(package_path, dataflow_idx=0, secrets=None, spark=None)` - submits the specified dataflow for execution, but does not return a dataframe.
- `run(package_path, dataflow_idx=0, secrets=None, spark=None)` - runs the specified dataflow and returns the results as a dataframe.
- `run_on_data(user_config, package_path, dataflow_idx=0, secrets=None, spark=None)` - runs the specified dataflow based on an in-memory data source and returns the results as a dataframe. The `user_config` argument is a dict that maps the absolute path of a data source (.dsource file) to an in-memory data source represented as a list of lists.

### Common arguments

- `package_path` is the path to the data preparation package (.dprep file).
- `dataflow_idx` is the zero-based index of which dataflow in the package to execute. If the specified dataflow references other dataflows or data sources, they are executed as well.
- `secrets` is an optional dict mapping keys to secrets.
- `spark` is an optional bool specifying whether to return a Spark dataframe or a Pandas dataframe. By default, Azure ML Workbench determines which kind of dataframe to return at runtime based on context.
