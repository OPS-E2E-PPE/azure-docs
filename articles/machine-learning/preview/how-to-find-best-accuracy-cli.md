# How to find runs with the best accuracy and lowest duration
Given multiple runs, one use case is to find runs with best accuracy. One approach is to use CLI with a JMESPATH query.
In the following example, four runs are created with accuracy values of 0, 0.98, 1, and 1. Runs are filtered if they are in the range [`MaxAccuracy-Threshold`, `MaxAccuracy`] where `Threshold = .03`.

## Sample data
If you don't have existing run histories with `Accuracy` value, the steps below will generate run histories for querying:

First, create a python file in the workbench, name it `log_accuracy.py`, and paste in the following code:
```python
from azureml.logging import get_azureml_logger

logger = get_azureml_logger()

accuracy_value = 0.5

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
     accuracy_value = float(sys.argv[1])

logger.log("Accuracy", accuracy_value)
```

Next, create a file `run.py`, and paste in the following code:
```python
import os

accuracy_values = [0, 0.98, 1.0, 1.0]
for value in accuracy_values:
    os.system('az ml experiment submit -c local ./log_accuracy.py {}'.format(value))
```

Lastly, open command line through workbench. Then run command `python run.py` to submit experiments. After script finishes, you should see four more runs under `Run History`.

## Querying the run history
The first command finds the max accuracy value.

    az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy != null] | max_by(@, &Accuracy).Accuracy'

Using this accuracy value (`1`) and threshold value (`0.03`), the second command will filter runs using `Accuracy` then sort runs by `duration` ascending.

    az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy >= sum(`[1, -0.03]`)] | sort_by(@, &duration)'
    
If you use powershell, the code below will use local variables to store threshold and max accuracy.

     $threshold = 0.03
     $max_accuracy_value = az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy != null] | max_by(@, &Accuracy).Accuracy'
     az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy >= sum(`[{0}, -{1}]`)] | sort_by(@, &duration)' -f $max_accuracy_value, $threshold
