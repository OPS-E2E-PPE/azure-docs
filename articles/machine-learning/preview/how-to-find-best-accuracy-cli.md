# How to find runs with the best accuracy and lowest duration
Given multiple runs, one use case is to find runs with the best accuracy. One approach is to use the command line interface (CLI) with a [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) query. For more information on using JMESPath in the Azure CLI, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/query-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). In the following example, four runs are created with accuracy values of 0, 0.98, 1, and 1. Runs are filtered if they are in the range `[MaxAccuracy-Threshold, MaxAccuracy]` where `Threshold = .03`.

## Sample data
If you don't have existing runs with an `Accuracy` value, the steps below will generate runs for querying:

First, create a python file in the workbench, name it `log_accuracy.py`, and paste in the following code:
```python
from azureml.logging import get_azureml_logger

logger = get_azureml_logger()

accuracy_value = 0.5

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
     accuracy_value = float(sys.argv[1])

logger.log("Accuracy", accuracy_value)
```

Next, create a file `run.py`, and paste in the following code:
```python
import os

accuracy_values = [0, 0.98, 1.0, 1.0]
for value in accuracy_values:
    os.system('az ml experiment submit -c local ./log_accuracy.py {}'.format(value))
```

Lastly, open the CLI through workbench and run command `python run.py` to submit four experiments. After the script finishes, you should see four more runs in the `Run History` tab.

## Querying the run history
The first command finds the max accuracy value.
```powershell
az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy != null] | max_by(@, &Accuracy).Accuracy'
```

Using this max accuracy value of `1` and a threshold value of `0.03`, the second command will filter runs using `Accuracy` then sort runs by `duration` ascending.
```powershell
az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy >= sum(`[1, -0.03]`)] | sort_by(@, &duration)'
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you want a strict upper bound check, the query format will be ``@[?Accuracy >= sum(`[$max_accuracy_value, -$threshold]`) && Accuracy <= `$max_accuracy_value`]``

If you use Powershell, the code below will use local variables to store threshold and max accuracy.
```powershell
$threshold = 0.03
$max_accuracy_value = az ml history list --query '@[?Accuracy != null] | max_by(@, &Accuracy).Accuracy'
$find_runs_query = '@[?Accuracy >= sum(`[{0}, -{1}]`)] | sort_by(@, &duration)' -f $max_accuracy_value, $threshold
az ml history list --query $find_runs_query
```
