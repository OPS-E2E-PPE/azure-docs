# Pricing and billing for Azure Machine Learning Services

For full details, or to view a sample bill, visit the [Azure pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/machine-learning-services/).  

Here are some commonly asked questions around billing and pricing.

**Are you charging for Azure Machine Learning during preview?**	

The Azure Machine Learning Workbench application is available free of charge to Azure subscribers.

The Experimentation Service and Model Management offer free tiers, in addition to paid tiers, available at a discount during Public Preview.

**Am I charged based on how many experiments I run?**

No, the Experimentation Service allows as many experiments as you need, and charges only based on the number of users. Experimentation compute resources are charged separately.  We encourage you to perform multiple experiments to arrive at the best model for your solution. 

**Am I charged based on how many times my web services is called?**

No. Web services can be called as often as required, without any Model Management billing implications. You have full control to scale your deployments to meet the needs of your applications.

**How can I scale the number of units I have purchased in the Azure Machine Learning Model Management?**

You can change the number of units, up or down, using either the Azure portal or the CLI. 

**What does a bill look like?**

Bills are produced daily. For billing purposes, a day commences at midnight UTC. Bills are generated monthly. Separate charges are incurred for any Azure services consumed in conjunction with Azure Machine Learning. Charges can include, but are not limited to: 
- Compute charges
- HDInsight
- Azure Container Service
- Azure Container Registry 
- Azure Blob Storage
- Application Insights
