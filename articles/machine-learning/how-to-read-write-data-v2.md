Learn how to read and write data for your training jobs with the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2(preview) and the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension v2. 
 
## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python v2](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro).

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace

```python

from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredential

#enter details of your AML workspace
subscription_id = '<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>'
resource_group = '<RESOURCE_GROUP>'
workspace = '<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>'

#get a handle to the workspace
ml_client = MLClient(InteractiveBrowserCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)
```

## Use local data in a job

You can use data from your current working directory in a training job with the JobInput class. 
The JobInput class allows you to define data inputs from a specific file, `uri_file` or a folder location, `uri_folder`. In the JobInput object, you specify the `path` of where your data is located; the path can be a local path or a cloud path. Azure Machine Learning supports `https://`, `abfss://`, `wasbs://` and `azureml://` URIs. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If the path is local, but your compute is defined to be in the cloud, Azure Machine Learning will automatically upload the data to cloud storage for you.

```python

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, UriReference, JobInput, CommandJob
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

my_job_inputs = {
    "input_data": JobInput(
        path='./sample_data', # change to be your local directory
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

job = CommandJob(
    code="./src", # local path where the code is stored
    command='python train.py --input_folder ${{inputs.input_data}}',
    inputs=my_job_inputs,
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu:9",
    compute="cpu-cluster"
)

#submit the command job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
#get a URL for the status of the job
returned_job.services["Studio"].endpoint
```

## Use data stored in storage service on Azure in a job

You can read your data in from existing storage on Azure.

# [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](#tab/ADLS-Gen2)

The following code shows how to read in data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2. 

```python

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, UriReference, JobInput, CommandJob
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

my_job_inputs = {
    "input_data": JobInput(
        path='abfss://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>',
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

job = CommandJob(
    code="./src", # local path where the code is stored
    command='python train.py --input_folder ${{inputs.input_data}}',
    inputs=my_job_inputs,
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu:9",
    compute="cpu-cluster"
)

#submit the command job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
#get a URL for the status of the job
returned_job.services["Studio"].endpoint
```

# [Azure Blob Storage](#tab/blob)

The following code shows how to read in data from Azure Blob Storage. 

```python

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, UriReference, JobInput, CommandJob
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

# in this example we
my_job_inputs = {
    "input_data": JobInput(
        path='https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/path',
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

job = CommandJob(
    code="./src", # local path where the code is stored
    command='python train.py --input_folder ${{inputs.input_data}}',
    inputs=my_job_inputs,
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu:9",
    compute="cpu-cluster"
)

#submit the command job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
#get a URL for the status of the job
returned_job.services["Studio"].endpoint
```

## Read and write data to cloud-based storage

You can read and write data from your job into your cloud-based storage. 

The JobInput defaults the mode - how the input will be exposed during job runtime - to InputOutputModes.RO_MOUNT (read-only mount). Put another way, Azure Machine Learning will mount the file or folder to the compute and set the file/folder to read-only. By design, you can't write to JobInputs only JobOutputs. The data is automatically uploaded to cloud storage.

# [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](#tab/ADLS-Gen2)

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, UriReference, JobInput, CommandJob, JobOutput
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

my_job_inputs = {
    "input_data": JobInput(
        path='abfss://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>',
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

my_job_outputs = {
    "output_folder": JobOutput(
        path='abfss://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>',
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

job = CommandJob(
    code="./src", #local path where the code is stored
    command='python pre-process.py --input_folder ${{inputs.input_data}} --output_folder ${{outputs.output_folder}}',
    inputs=my_job_inputs,
    outputs=my_job_outputs,
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu:9",
    compute="cpu-cluster"
)

#submit the command job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)

#get a URL for the status of the job
returned_job.services["Studio"].endpoint

```

# [Azure Blob Storage ](#tab/blob)

```python

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, UriReference, JobInput, CommandJob, JobOutput
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

my_job_inputs = {
    "input_data": JobInput(
        path='https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/path',
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

my_job_outputs = {
    "output_folder": JobOutput(
        path='https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/path',
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER
    )
}

job = CommandJob(
    code="./src", #local path where the code is stored
    command='python pre-process.py --input_folder ${{inputs.input_data}} --output_folder ${{outputs.output_folder}}',
    inputs=my_job_inputs,
    outputs=my_job_outputs,
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu:9",
    compute="cpu-cluster"
)

#submit the command job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)
#get a URL for the status of the job
returned_job.services["Studio"].endpoint
```

## Register data

You can register data as an asset to your workspace. The benefits of registering data are:

* Easy to share with other members of the team (no need to remember file locations)
* Versioning of the metadata (location, description, etc.)
* Lineage tracking

The following example demonstrates versioning of sample data, and shows how to register a local file as a data asset. The data is uploaded to cloud storage and registered as an asset.

```python

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

my_data = Data(
    path="./sample_data/titanic.csv",
    type=AssetTypes.URI_FILE,
    description="Titanic Data",
    name="titanic",
    version='1'
)

ml_client.data.create_or_update(my_data)
``` 

To register data that is in a cloud location, you can specify the path with any of the supported protocols for the storage type. The following example shows what the path looks like for data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2. 

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

my_path = 'abfss://<file_system>@<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>' # adls gen2

my_data = Data(
    path=my_path,
    type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER,
    description="description here",
    name="a_name",
    version='1'
)

ml_client.data.create_or_update(my_data)

```

## Consume registered data assets in jobs

Once your data is registered as an asset to the workspace, you can consume that data asset in jobs.
The following example demonstrates how to consume `version` 1 of the registered data asset `titanic`. 

```python

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, UriReference, JobInput, CommandJob
from azure.ai.ml._constants import AssetTypes

registered_data_asset = ml_client.data.get(name='titanic', version='1')

my_job_inputs = {
    "input_data": JobInput(
        type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER,
        path=registered_data_asset.id
    )
}

job = CommandJob(
    code="./src", 
    command='python read_data_asset.py --input_folder ${{inputs.input_data}}',
    inputs=my_job_inputs,
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu:9",
    compute="cpu-cluster"
)

#submit the command job
returned_job = ml_client.create_or_update(job)

#get a URL for the status of the job
returned_job.services["Studio"].endpoint
```

## Use data in pipelines 

If you're working with Azure Machine Learning pipelines, you can read data into and move data between pipeline components with the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2 extension or the Python SDK v2 (preview). 

### Azure Machine Learning CLI v2
The following YAML file demonstrates how to use the output data from one component as the input for another component of the pipeline using the Azure Machine Learning CLI v2 extension:

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-sdk-preview/cli/jobs/pipelines-with-components/basics/3b_pipeline_with_data/pipeline.yml":::

## Python SDK v2 (preview)

The following example defines a pipeline containing three nodes and moves data between each node.

* `prepare_data_node` that loads the image and labels from Fashion MNIST data set into `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv`.
* `train_node` that trains a CNN model with Keras using the training data, `mnist_train.csv` .
* `score_node` that scores the model using test data, `mnist_test.csv`.
