# Vector stores in Azure Machine Learning (preview)

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer](includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

This concept article helps you use a vector index in Azure Machine Learning for performing Retrieval Augmented Generation. A vector index stores embeddings, which are numerical representations of concepts (data) converted to number sequences, which enable LLMs to understand the relationships between those concepts. Creating vector stores helps you to hook up your data with an LLM and retrieve the data efficiently.

Azure Machine Learning supports embedding vectors to be stored in two types of vector stores. Faiss and Azure Cognitive Search.

Faiss is a local file-based store. The Vector Index is stored in the storage account of your Azure Machine Learning workspace. Since it's stored locally, the costs are minimal making it ideal for development and testing.

Azure Cognitive Search index uses the Azure Cognitive Search service to store the index. Apart from being an index store, this type of index with more features. It allows for large size and scale, making it a good fit for production scenarios or scenarios where the special features are needed.


The following tables list pros and cons for each type of Index:

**Faiss**

| Pros	| Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| No costs for creating an index: only storage cost | Limited query capabilities, embedding vector similarity search | 
| Can be built and queried in-memory | Hosting for access in an application needs user to set up |
| Easy to share copies for individual use |  | 
| Scales with underlying compute loading Index |  | 

 

**Azure Cognitive Search**

 
| Pros	| Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Supports Vector Search, Semantic search, filters | Monthly subscription fees | 
| Can be scaled via replicas and partitions as needed | Initial setup is complex: need to provision and manage Azure Resource, need to grant access for local dev usage/manage secrets |
| Support and detailed documentation are available on service features/limitations | Limitations on number of vectors, which can be stored in index |
