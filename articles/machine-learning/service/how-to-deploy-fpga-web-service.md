# Deploy a model as a web service on an FPGA with Azure Machine Learning service

You can deploy a model as a web service on [field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)](concept-accelerate-with-fpgas.md) with Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models. Using FPGAs provides ultra-low latency inferencing, even with a single batch size.

These models are currently available:
  - ResNet 50
  - ResNet 152
  - DenseNet-121
  - VGG-16
  - SSD-VGG

The FPGAs are available in these Azure regions:
  - East US
  - West US 2
  - West Europe
  - Southeast Asia

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To optimize latency and throughput, your client sending data to the FPGA model should be in one of the regions above (the one you deployed the model to).

## Prerequisites

- If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.

- An Azure Machine Learning service workspace and the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python installed. Learn how to get these prerequisites using the [How to configure a development environment](how-to-configure-environment.md) document.
 
  - Install the Python SDK for hardware-accelerated models:

    ```shell
    pip install --upgrade azureml-accel-models
    ```

## Sample notebooks

For your convenience, [sample notebooks](https://aka.ms/aml-notebooks) are available for the example below and in addition to other examples.  Look under how-to-use-azureml and deployment folders for accelerated models.

## Create and containerize your model

This document will describe how to create a TensorFlow graph to preprocess the input image, make it a featurizer using ResNet 50 on an FPGA, and then run the features through a classifier trained on the ImageNet data set.

Follow the instructions to:

* Define the TensorFlow model
* Deploy the model
* Consume the deployed model
* Delete deployed services

### Load Azure ML workspace

Load your Azure ML workspace.

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf
 
from azureml.core import Workspace
 
ws = Workspace.from_config()
print(ws.name, ws.resource_group, ws.location, ws.subscription_id, sep = '\n')
```

### Preprocess image

The input to the web service is a JPEG image.  The first step is to decode the JPEG image and preprocess it.  The JPEG images are treated as strings and the result are tensors that will be the input to the ResNet 50 model.

```python
# Input images as a two-dimensional tensor containing an arbitrary number of images represented a strings
import azureml.accel.models.utils as utils
in_images = tf.placeholder(tf.string)
image_tensors = utils.preprocess_array(in_images)
print(image_tensors.shape)
```

### Load featurizer

Initialize the model and download a TensorFlow checkpoint of the quantized version of ResNet50 to be used as a featurizer.  You may replace "QuantizedResnet50" in the code snippet below with by importing other deep neural networks:

- QuantizedResnet152
- QuantizedVgg16
- Densenet121

```python
from azureml.accel.models import QuantizedResnet50
save_path = os.path.expanduser('~/models')
model_graph = QuantizedResnet50(save_path, is_frozen = True)
feature_tensor = model_graph.import_graph_def(image_tensors)
print(model_graph.version)
print(feature_tensor.name)
print(feature_tensor.shape)
```

### Add classifier

This classifier has been trained on the ImageNet data set.  Examples for transfer learning and training your customized weights are available in the set of [sample notebooks](https://aka.ms/aml-notebooks).

```python
classifier_output = model_graph.get_default_classifier(feature_tensor)
print(classifier_output)
```

### Save the model

Now that the preprocessor, ResNet 50 featurizer, and the classifier have been loaded, save the graph and associated variables as a model.

```python
model_name = "resnet50"
model_def_path = os.path.join(save_path, model_name)
print("Saving model in {}".format(model_def_path))

with tf.Session() as sess:
    model_graph.restore_weights(sess)
    tf.saved_model.simple_save(sess, model_def_path,
                                   inputs={'images': in_images},
                                   outputs={'output_alias': classifier_output})
```

### Register model

[Register](./concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) the model that you created.  Adding tags and other metadata about the model helps you keep track of your trained models.

```python
from azureml.core.model import Model

registered_model = Model.register(workspace = ws
                                  model_path = model_def_path,
                                  model_name = model_name)

print("Successfully registered: ", registered_model.name, registered_model.description, registered_model.version, sep = '\t')
```

If you've already registered a model and want to load it, you may retrieve it.

```python
from azureml.core.model import Model
model_name = "resnet50"
# By default, the latest version is retrieved. You can specify the version, i.e. version=1
registered_model = Model(ws, name="resnet50")
print(registered_model.name, registered_model.description, registered_model.version, sep = '\t')
```

### Convert model

The TensorFlow graph needs to be converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange format ([ONNX](https://onnx.ai/)).  You will need to provide the names of the input and output tensors, and these names will be used by your client when you consume the web service.

```python
input_tensor = in_images.name
output_tensors = classifier_output.name

print(input_tensor)
print(output_tensors)


from azureml.accel.accel_onnx_converter import AccelOnnxConverter

convert_request = AccelOnnxConverter.convert_tf_model(ws, registered_model, input_tensor, output_tensors)
convert_request.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)

# If the above call succeeded, get the converted model
converted_model = convert_request.result
print(converted_model.name, converted_model.url, converted_model.version, converted_model.id,converted_model.created_time)
```

### Create Docker image

The converted model and all dependencies are added to a Docker image.  This Docker image can then be deployed and instantiated in the cloud or a supported edge device such as [Azure Data Box Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-overview).  You can also add tags and descriptions for your registered Docker image.

```python
from azureml.core.image import Image
from azureml.accel.accel_container_image import AccelContainerImage

image_config = AccelContainerImage.image_configuration()
image_name = "{}-image".format(model_name)

image = Image.create(name = image_name,
                     models = [converted_model],
                     image_config = image_config, 
                     workspace = ws)


image.wait_for_creation(show_output = True)
```

List the images by tag and get the detailed logs for any debugging.

```python
for i in Image.list(workspace = ws):
    print('{}(v.{} [{}]) stored at {} with build log {}'.format(i.name, i.version, i.creation_state, i.image_location, i.image_build_log_uri))
```

## Model deployment

### Deploy to the cloud

To deploy your model as a high-scale production web service, use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You can create a new one using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, CLI, or the Azure portal.

```python
# Use the default configuration (can also provide parameters to customize)
prov_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration()

aks_name = 'my-aks-9' 
# Create the cluster
aks_target = ComputeTarget.create(workspace = ws, 
                                  name = aks_name, 
                                  provisioning_configuration = prov_config)

%%time
aks_target.wait_for_completion(show_output = True)
print(aks_target.provisioning_state)
print(aks_target.provisioning_errors)

#Set the web service configuration (using default here)
aks_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration()

%%time
aks_service_name ='aks-service-1'

aks_service = Webservice.deploy_from_image(workspace = ws, 
                                           name = aks_service_name,
                                           image = image,
                                           deployment_config = aks_config,
                                           deployment_target = aks_target)
aks_service.wait_for_deployment(show_output = True)
print(aks_service.state)
print(aks_service.scoring_uri)
```

#### Test the cloud service
The Docker image supports gRPC and the TensorFlow Serving "predict" API.  Use the sample client to call into the Docker image to get predictions from the model.  Sample client code is available:
- [Python](https://github.com/Azure/aml-real-time-ai/blob/master/pythonlib/amlrealtimeai/client.py)
- [C#](https://github.com/Azure/aml-real-time-ai/blob/master/sample-clients/csharp)

If you want to use TensorFlow Serving, you can [download a sample client](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/setup).

```python
import requests
classes_entries = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lasagne/Recipes/master/examples/resnet50/imagenet_classes.txt").text.splitlines()

# Score image using input and output tensor names
results = client.score_file(path="./snowleopardgaze.jpg", 
                             input_name=input_tensor, 
                             outputs=output_tensors)

# map results [class_id] => [confidence]
results = enumerate(results)
# sort results by confidence
sorted_results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
# print top 5 results
for top in sorted_results[:5]:
    print(classes_entries[top[0]], 'confidence:', top[1])
```

### Clean-up the service
Delete your web service, image, and model (must be done in this order since there are dependencies).

```python
aks_service.delete()
image.delete()
registered_model.delete()
converted_model.delete()
```

## Deploy to a local edge server

All [Azure Data Box Edge devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-overview
) contain an FPGA for running the model.  Only one model can be running on the FPGA at one time.  To run a different model, just deploy a new container. Instructions and sample code can be found in [this Azure Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aml-hardware-accelerated-models).
