# Authentication for managed online endpoints

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-dev-v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

This article explains the concepts of identity and permission in the context of online endpoints. We begin with a discussion of [Microsoft Entra IDs](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) that support [Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md). Depending on the purpose of the Microsoft Entra identity, we refer to it either as a _user identity_ or an _endpoint identity_.

A _user identity_ is a Microsoft Entra ID that you can use to create an endpoint and its deployment(s), or use to interact with endpoints or workspaces. In other words, an identity can be considered a user identity if it's issuing requests to endpoints, deployments, or workspaces. The user identity would need proper permissions to perform control plane and data plane operations on the endpoints or workspaces.

An _endpoint identity_ is a Microsoft Entra ID that runs the user container in deployments. In other words, if the identity is associated with the endpoint and used for the user container for the deployment, then it's called an endpoint identity. The endpoint identity would also need proper permissions for the user container to interact with resources as needed. For example, the endpoint identity would need the proper permissions to pull images from the Azure Container Registry or to interact with other Azure services.

## Limitation

Microsoft Entra ID authentication (`aad_token`) is supported for managed online endpoints __only__. For Kubernetes online endpoints, you can use either a key or an Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`).

## Permissions needed for user identity

When you sign in to your Azure tenant with your Microsoft account (for example, using `az login`), you complete the user authentication step (commonly known as _authn_) and your identity as a user is determined. Now, say you want to create an online endpoint under a workspace, you'll need the proper permission to do so. This is where authorization (commonly known as _authz_) comes in.

### Control plane operations

_Control plane operations_ control and change the online endpoints. These operations include create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on online endpoints and online deployments. For online endpoints and deployments, requests to perform control plane operations go to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

#### Authentication for control plane operations

For control plane operations, you have one way to authenticate a client to the workspace: by using a __Microsoft Entra token__.

Depending on your use case, you can choose from [several authentication workflows to get this token](how-to-setup-authentication.md). Your user identity also needs to have a proper Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allowed for access to your resources.

#### Authorization for control plane operations

For control plane operations, your user identity needs to have a proper Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allowed for access to your resources. Specifically, for CRUD operations on online endpoints and deployments, you need the identity to have the role assigned with the following actions:

| Operation | Required Azure RBAC role | Scope that the role is assigned for |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Create/update operations on online endpoints and deployments | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/write` | workspace |
| Delete operations on online endpoints and deployments | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/delete` | workspace |
| Create/update/delete operations on online endpoints and deployments via the Azure Machine Learning studio | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` | resource group where the workspace belongs |
| Read operations on online endpoints and deployments | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/read` | workspace |
| Fetch an Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`) for invoking online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) from the workspace | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/token/action` | endpoint |
| Fetch a key for invoking online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) from the workspace | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/listKeys/action` | endpoint |
| Regenerate keys for online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/regenerateKeys/action` | endpoint |
| Fetch a Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`) for invoking _managed_ online endpoints | Doesn't require a role. | not applicable|

> [!NOTE]
> You can fetch your Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`) directly from Microsoft Entra ID once you're signed in, and you don't need extra Azure RBAC permission on the workspace.


### Data plane operations

_Data plane operations_ don't change the online endpoints, rather, they use data to interact with the endpoints. An example of a data plane operation is to send a scoring request to an online endpoint and get a response from it. For online endpoints and deployments, requests to perform data plane operations go to the endpoint's scoring URI.

#### Authentication for data plane operations

For data plane operations, you can choose from three ways to authenticate a client to send requests to an endpoint's scoring URI:

- key
- Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`)
- Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`)

For more information on how to authenticate clients for data plane operations, see [How to authenticate clients for online endpoints](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).

#### Authorization for data plane operations

For data plane operations, your user identity needs to have a proper Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allowed for access to your resources, only if the endpoint is set to use Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`). Specifically, for data plane operations on online endpoints and deployments, you need the identity to have the role assigned with the following actions:


| Operation | Required Azure RBAC role | Scope that the role is assigned for |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Invoke online endpoints with key or Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`). | Doesn't require a role. | Not applicable |
| Invoke _managed_ online endpoints with Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`). | Owner, contributor, or any role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/score/action` | endpoint |
| Invoke _Kubernetes_ online endpoints with Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`). | Doesn't require a role. | Not applicable |


## Permissions needed for endpoint identity

An online deployment runs your user container with the _endpoint identity_, that is, the managed identity associated with the endpoint. The endpoint identity is a [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) that supports [Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md). Therefore, you can assign Azure roles to the endpoint identity to control permissions that are required to perform operations. This endpoint identity can be either a system-assigned identity (SAI) or a user-assigned identity (UAI). You can decide whether to use an SAI or a UAI when you create the endpoint.

- For a _system-assigned identity_, the identity is created automatically when you create the endpoint, and roles with fundamental permissions (such as the Azure Container Registry pull permission and the storage blob data reader) are automatically assigned.
- For a _user-assigned identity_, you need to create the identity first, and then associate it with the endpoint when you create the endpoint. You're also responsible for assigning proper roles to the UAI as needed.

### Automatic role assignment for endpoint identity

Online endpoints require Azure Container Registry (ACR) pull permission on the ACR associated with the workspace. They also require Storage Blob Data Reader permission on the default datastore of the workspace. By default, these permissions are automatically granted to the endpoint identity if the endpoint identity is a system-assigned identity.

Also, when creating an endpoint, if you set the flag to enforce access to the default secret stores, the endpoint identity is automatically granted the permission to read secrets from workspace connections.

There's no automatic role assignment if the endpoint identity is a user-assigned identity.

In more detail:
- If you use a system-assigned identity (SAI) for the endpoint, roles with fundamental permissions (such as Azure Container Registry pull permission, and Storage Blob Data Reader) are automatically assigned to the endpoint identity. Also, you can set a flag on the endpoint to allow its SAI have the permission to read secrets from workspace connections. To have this permission, the `Azure Machine Learning Workspace Connection Secret Reader` role would be automatically assigned to the endpoint identity. For this role to be automatically assigned to the endpoint identity, the following conditions must be met:
  - Your _user identity_, that is, the identity that creates the endpoint, has the permissions to read secrets from workspace connections when creating the endpoint.
  - The endpoint uses an SAI.
  - The endpoint is defined with a flag to enforce access to default secret stores (workspace connections under the current workspace) when creating the endpoint.
- If your endpoint uses a UAI, or it uses the Key Vault as the secret store with an SAI. In these cases, you need to manually assign to the endpoint identity the role with the proper permissions to read secrets from the Key Vault.


## Choosing the permissions and scope for authorization

Azure RBAC allows you to define and assign __roles__ with a set of allowed and/or denied __actions__ on specific __scopes__. You can customize these roles and scopes according to your business needs. The following examples serve as a starting point and can be extended as necessary.

__Examples for user identity__

- To control all operations listed in the previous [table for control plane operations](#authorization-for-control-plane-operations) and the table for [data plane operations](#authorization-for-data-plane-operations), you can consider using a built-in role `AzureML Data Scientist` that includes the permission action `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/*/actions`.
- To control the operations for a specific endpoint, consider using the scope `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspaceName>/onlineEndpoints/<endpointName>`.
- To control the operations for all endpoints in a workspace, consider using the scope `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspaceName>`.

__Examples for endpoint identity__

- To allow the user container to read blobs, consider using a built-in role `Storage Blob Data Reader` that includes the permission data action `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read`.
