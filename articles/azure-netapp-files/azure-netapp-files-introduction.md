# What is Azure NetApp Files?

Azure NetApp Files is an Azure native, first-party, enterprise-class, high-performance file storage service. It provides _Volumes as a service_ for which you can create NetApp accounts, capacity pools, volumes, select service and performance levels, and manage data protection. It allows you to create and manage high-performance, highly available, and scalable file shares, using the same protocols and tools that you're familiar with and enterprise applications rely on on-premises.

Azure NetApp Filesâ€™ key attributes are:

-	Performance, cost optimization and scale
-	Simplicity and availability
-	Data management and security

Azure NetApp Files supports SMB, NFS and dual protocols volumes and can be used for various use cases such as:
- file sharing
- home directories 
-	databases
-	high-performance computing and more 

For more information about workload solutions leveraging Azure NetApp Files, see [Solution architectures using Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-solution-architectures.md).

## Performance, cost optimization, and scale 

Azure NetApp Files is designed to provide high-performance file storage for enterprise workloads and provide functionality to provide cost optimization and scale. Key features that contribute to these include:

| Functionality | Description | Benefit | 
| - | - | - | 
| In-Azure bare-metal flash performance | Fast and reliable all-flash performance with submillisecond latency | Run performance-intensive workloads in the cloud with on-premises infrastructure-level performance 
| Multi-protocol support | Supports multiple protocols including NFSv3, NFSv4.1, SMB 3.0, SMB 3.1.1 and simultaneous dual-protocol | Seamlessly integrate with existing infrastructure and workflows without compatibility issues or complex configurations. |
| Three flexible performance tiers (standard, premium, ultra) | Three performance tiers with dynamic service level change capability based on workload needs, including cool access for cold data | Choose the right performance level for workloads and dynamically adjust performance without overspending on resources. 
| Small-to-large volumes | Easily resize file volumes from 100 GiB up to 100 TiB without downtime | Scale storage as business needs grow without over-provisioning, avoiding upfront cost. 
| 1-TiB minimum capacity pool size | 1-TiB capacity pool is a reduced size storage pool compared to the initial 4 TiB minimum | Save money by starting with a smaller storage footprint and lower entry point, without sacrificing performance or availability. Scale storage based on growth without high upfront costs. 
| 1000-TiB maximum capacity pool | 1000-TiB capacity pool is an increased storage pool compared to the initial 500 TiB maximum | Reduce waste by creating larger, pooled capacity and performance budget and share/distribute across volumes. 
| 100-500 TiB large volumes | Store large volumes of data up to 500 TiB in a single volume | Manage large data sets and high-performance workloads with ease. 
| User and group quotas | Set quotas on storage usage for individual users and groups | Control storage usage and optimize resource allocation. 
| Virtual machine (VM) networked storage performance | Higher VM network throughput compared to disk IO limits enable more-demanding workloads on smaller Azure VMs | Improve application performance at a smaller virtual machine footprint, improving overall efficiency and lowering application license cost. 
| Deep workload readiness | Seamless deployment and migration of any-size workload with well-documented deployment guides | Easily migrate any workload of any size to the platform. Enjoy a seamless, cost-effective deployment and migration experience. 
| Datastores for Azure VMware Solution | Use Azure NetApp Files as a storage solution for VMware workloads in Azure, reducing the need for superfluous compute nodes normally included with Azure VMware Solution expansions | Save money by eliminating the need for unnecessary compute nodes when expanding storage, resulting in significant cost savings. 
| Standard storage with cool access | Use the cool access option of Azure NetApp Files Standard service level to move inactive data transparently from Azure NetApp Files Standard service-level storage (the hot tier) to an Azure storage account (the cool tier) | Save money by transitioning data that resides within Azure NetApp Files volumes (the hot tier) by moving blocks to the lower cost storage (the cool tier). |

These features work together to provide a high-performance file storage solution for the demands of enterprise workloads. They help to ensure that your workloads experience optimal (low) storage latency, cost and scale.

## Simplicity and availability

Azure NetApp Files is designed to provide simplicity and high availability for your file storage needs. Key features include:

| Functionality | Description | Benefit | 
| - | - | - | 
| Volumes as a Service | Provision and manage volumes in minutes with a few clicks like any other Azure service | Enables businesses to quickly and easily provision and manage volumes without the need for dedicated hardware or complex configurations. 
| Native Azure Integration | Integration with the Azure portal, REST, CLI, billing, monitoring, and security | Simplifies management and ensures consistency with other Azure services, while providing a familiar interface and integration with existing tools and workflows.
| High availability | Azure NetApp Files provides a [high availability SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/netapp/) with automatic failover | Ensures that data is always available and accessible, avoiding downtime and disruption to business operations.
| Application migration | Migrate applications to Azure without refactoring | Enables businesses to move their workloads to Azure quickly and easily without the need for costly and time-consuming application refactoring or redesign.
| Cross-region and cross-zone replication | Replicate data between regions or zones | Provide disaster recovery capabilities and ensure data availability and redundancy across different Azure regions or availability zones.
| Application volume groups | Application volume groups enable you to deploy all application volumes according to best practices in a single one-step and optimized workflow | Simplified multi-volume deployment for applications, ensuring volumes and mount points are optimized and adhere to best practices in a single step, saving time and effort.
| Programmatic deployment | Automate deployment and management with APIs and SDKs | Enables businesses to integrate Azure NetApp Files with their existing automation and management tools, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving efficiency.
| Fault-tolerant bare metal | Built on a fault-tolerant bare metal fleet powered by ONTAP | Ensures high performance and reliability by leveraging a robust, fault-tolerant storage platform and powerful data management capabilities provided by ONTAP.
| Azure native billing | Integrates natively with Azure billing, providing a seamless and easy-to-use billing experience, based on hourly usage | Easily and accurately manage and track the cost of using the service, allowing for seamless budgeting and cost control. Easily track usage and expenses directly from the Azure portal, providing a unified experience for billing and management. |

These features work together to provide a simple-to-use and highly available file storage solution to ensure that your data is easy to manage and always available, recoverable, and accessible to your applications even in an outage.
