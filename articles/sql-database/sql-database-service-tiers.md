# What are Azure SQL Database service tiers?

[Azure SQL Database](sql-database-technical-overview.md) offers **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Premium** service tiers for both [single databases](sql-database-single-database-resources.md) and [elastic pools](sql-database-elastic-pool.md). SQL Database offers a General Purpose service tier for [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](sql-database-managed-instance.md#managed-instance-service-tier). Service tiers are primarily differentiated by a range of performance level and storage size choices, and price.  All service tiers provide flexibility in changing performance level and storage size.  Single databases and elastic pools are billed hourly based on service tier, performance level, and storage size.   

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SQL Database Managed Instance, currently in public preview, offers a single general-purpose service tier. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](sql-database-managed-instance.md). The remainder of this article does not apply to Managed Instance.

## Choosing a service tier

Choosing a service tier depends primarily on business continuity, storage, and performance requirements.
| | **Basic** | **Standard** |**Premium**  |
| :-- | --: |--:| --:| --:| 
|Target workload|Development and production|Development and production|Development and production||
|Uptime SLA|99.99%|99.99%|99.99%|N/A while in preview|
|Backup retention|7 days|35 days|35 days|
|CPU|Low|Low, Medium, High|Medium, High|
|IO throughput (approximate) |2.5 IOPS per DTU	| 2.5 IOPS per DTU | 48 IOPS per DTU|
|IO latency (approximate)|5 ms (read), 10 ms (write)|5 ms (read), 10 ms (write)|2 ms (read/write)|
|Columnstore indexing |N/A|S3 and above|Supported|
|In-memory OLTP|N/A|N/A|Supported|

## Performance level and storage size limits

Performance levels are expressed in terms of Database Transaction Units (DTUs) for single databases and elastic Database Transaction Units (eDTUs) for elastic pools. For more on DTUs and eDTUs, see [What are DTUs and eDTUs?](sql-database-what-is-a-dtu.md)

### Single databases

|  | **Basic** | **Standard** | **Premium** | 
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Maximum storage size* | 2 GB | 1 TB | 4 TB  | 
| Maximum DTUs | 5 | 3000 | 4000 | |
||||||

### Elastic pools

| | **Basic** | **Standard** | **Premium** | 
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Maximum storage size per database*  | 2 GB | 1 TB | 1 TB | 
| Maximum storage size per pool* | 156 GB | 4 TB | 4 TB | 
| Maximum eDTUs per database | 5 | 3000 | 4000 | 
| Maximum eDTUs per pool | 1600 | 3000 | 4000 | 
| Maximum number of databases per pool | 500  | 500 | 100 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> \* Storage sizes greater than the amount of included storage are in preview and extra costs apply. For details, see [SQL Database pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/). 
>
> \* In the Premium tier, more than 1 TB of storage is currently available in the following regions: Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Canada Central, Canada East, Central US, France Central, Germany Central, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, South East Asia, UK South, UK West, US East2, West US, US Gov Virginia, and West Europe. See [P11-P15 Current Limitations](sql-database-resource-limits.md#single-database-limitations-of-p11-and-p15-when-the-maximum-size-greater-than-1-tb).
