# Quickstart: Send events to and receive events from Azure Event Hubs - .NET (Azure.Messaging.EventHubs) 
In this quickstart, you will learn how to send events to and receive events from an event hub using the **Azure.Messaging.EventHubs** .NET library. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can find all .NET samples for Event Hubs in our [.NET SDK repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/eventhub/). 
> - [Event Hubs samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples)
> - [Event processor samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/samples)


## Prerequisites
If you're new to Azure Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) before you do this quickstart. 

To complete this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

- **Microsoft Azure subscription**. To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you need a subscription.  If you don't have an existing Azure account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022**. The Azure Event Hubs client library makes use of new features that were introduced in C# 8.0.  You can still use the library with  previous C# language versions, but the new syntax won't be available. To make use of the full syntax, we recommend that you compile with the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.0 or higher and [language version](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version#override-a-default) set to `latest`. If you're using Visual Studio, versions before Visual Studio 2022 aren't compatible with the tools needed to build C# 8.0 projects. Visual Studio 2022, including the free Community edition, can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
- **Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub**. The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md).

## Send events

---
### Authenticate the app to Azure

[!INCLUDE [event-hub-passwordless-template-tabbed](../../includes/passwordless/event-hub/event-hub-passwordless-template-tabbed.md)]

### Write code to send events to the event hub

Add the following code to the top of the **Program.cs** file.

## [Passwordless](#tab/passwordless)

Here are the important steps from the code:

1. Creates an [EventHubProducerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) object using the namespace and the event hub name. 
1. Invokes the [CreateBatchAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.createbatchasync) method on the [EventHubProducerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) object to create an [EventDataBatch](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventdatabatch) object.     
1. Add events to the batch using the [EventDataBatch.TryAdd](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventdatabatch.tryadd) method. 
1. Sends the batch of messages to the event hub using the [EventHubProducerClient.SendAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.sendasync) method.
  
In the code sample below, replace the `<EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE>` and `<HUB_NAME>` placeholder values for the `EventHubProducerClient` parameters.
```csharp
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer;
using System.Text;

// number of events to be sent to the event hub
int numOfEvents = 3;

// The Event Hubs client types are safe to cache and use as a singleton for the lifetime
// of the application, which is best practice when events are being published or read regularly.
// TODO: Replace the <EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE> and <HUB_NAME> placeholder values
EventHubProducerClient producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(
    "<EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE>.servicebus.windows.net",
    "<HUB_NAME>",
    new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Create a batch of events 
using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync();

for (int i = 1; i <= numOfEvents; i++)
{
    if (!eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"Event {i}"))))
    {
        // if it is too large for the batch
        throw new Exception($"Event {i} is too large for the batch and cannot be sent.");
    }
}

try
{
    // Use the producer client to send the batch of events to the event hub
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
    Console.WriteLine($"A batch of {numOfEvents} events has been published.");
}
finally
{
    await producerClient.DisposeAsync();
}
```

## [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

Here are the important steps from the code:

1. Creates a [EventHubProducerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) object using the primary connection string to the namespace and the event hub name. 
1. Invokes the [CreateBatchAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.createbatchasync) method on the [EventHubProducerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) object to create a [EventDataBatch](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventdatabatch) object.     
1. Add events to the batch using the [EventDataBatch.TryAdd](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventdatabatch.tryadd) method. 
1. Sends the batch of messages to the event hub using the [EventHubProducerClient.SendAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.sendasync) method.
  
In the code sample below, replace the `<CONNECTION_STRING>` and `<HUB_NAME>` placeholder values for the `EventHubProducerClient` parameters.

```csharp
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Producer;
using System.Text;

// number of events to be sent to the event hub
int numOfEvents = 3;

// The Event Hubs client types are safe to cache and use as a singleton for the lifetime
// of the application, which is best practice when events are being published or read regularly.
// TODO: Replace the <CONNECTION_STRING> and <HUB_NAME> placeholder values
EventHubProducerClient producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(
    "<CONNECTION_STRING>",
    "<HUB_NAME>");

// Create a batch of events 
using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync();

for (int i = 1; i <= numOfEvents; i++)
{
    if (!eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"Event {i}"))))
    {
        // if it is too large for the batch
        throw new Exception($"Event {i} is too large for the batch and cannot be sent.");
    }
}

try
{
    // Use the producer client to send the batch of events to the event hub
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
    Console.WriteLine($"A batch of {numOfEvents} events has been published.");
}
finally
{
    await producerClient.DisposeAsync();
}
```
---
5. Build the project, and ensure that there are no errors.
6. Run the program and wait for the confirmation message. 

    ```csharp
    A batch of 3 events has been published.
    ```
1. In the Azure portal, you can verify that the event hub has received the events. Switch to **Messages** view in the **Metrics** section. Refresh the page to update the chart. It may take a few seconds for it to show that the messages have been received.

    > For the complete source code with more informational comments, see [this file on the GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples/Sample04_PublishingEvents.md)

## Receive events
This section shows how to write a .NET Core console application that receives events from an event hub using an event processor. The event processor simplifies receiving events from event hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receptions from those event hubs. An event processor is associated with a specific event Hub and a consumer group. It receives events from multiple partitions in the event hub, passing them to a handler delegate for processing using code that you provide. 



> [!WARNING]
> If you run this code on **Azure Stack Hub**, you will experience runtime errors unless you target a specific Storage API version. That's because the Event Hubs SDK uses the latest available Azure Storage API available in  Azure that may not be available on your Azure Stack Hub platform. Azure Stack Hub may support a different version of Storage Blob SDK than those typically available on Azure. If you are using Azure Blob Storage as a checkpoint store, check the [supported Azure Storage API version for your Azure Stack Hub build](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-acs-differences?#api-version) and target that version in your code. 
>
> For example, If you are running on Azure Stack Hub version 2005, the highest available version for the Storage service is version 2019-02-02. By default, the Event Hubs SDK client library uses the highest available version on Azure (2019-07-07 at the time of the release of the SDK). In this case, besides following steps in this section, you will also need to add code to target the Storage service API version 2019-02-02. For an example on how to target a specific Storage API version, see [this sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/samples/). 



### Create an Azure Storage Account and a blob container
In this quickstart, you use Azure Storage as the checkpoint store. Follow these steps to create an Azure Storage account. 

1. [Create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal)
2. [Create a blob container](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md#create-a-container)
3. Authenticate to the blob container
    
## [Passwordless](#tab/passwordless)

[!INCLUDE [event-hub-storage-assign-roles](../../includes/passwordless/event-hub/event-hub-storage-assign-roles.md)]
## [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

[Get the connection string to the storage account](../storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string.md)

Note down the connection string and the container name. You'll use them in the receive code. 

---
### Create a project for the receiver

1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **EventHubQuickStart** solution, point to **Add**, and select **New Project**. 
1. Select **Console application**, and select **Next**. 
1. Enter **EventHubsReceiver** for the **Project name**, and select **Create**. 
1. In the **Solution Explorer** window, right-click **EventHubsReceiver**, and select **Set as a Startup Project**. 

### Add the NuGet packages to the project

### [Passwordless](#tab/passwordless)

1. Select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console** from the menu.
1. In the **Package Manager Console** window, confirm that **EventHubsReceiver** is selected for the **Default project**. If not, use the drop-down list to select **EventHubsReceiver**.
1. Run the following command to install the **Azure.Messaging.EventHubs** and the **Azure.Identity** NuGet packages.

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs
    Install-Package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor
    Install-Package Azure.Identity
    ```

### [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

1. Select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console** from the menu.
1. In the **Package Manager Console** window, confirm that **EventHubsReceiver** is selected for the **Default project**. If not, use the drop-down list to select **EventHubsReceiver**.
1. Run the following command to install the **Azure.Messaging.EventHubs** NuGet package:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs
    Install-Package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor
    ```

---
### Update the code

Replace the contents of **Program.cs** with the following code:

## [Passwordless](#tab/passwordless)

Here are the important steps from the code:

1. Creates an [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object using the event hub namespace and the event hub name. You need to build [BlobContainerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobcontainerclient) object for the container in the Azure storage you created earlier.
1. Specifies handlers for the [ProcessEventAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.processeventasync) and [ProcessErrorAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.processerrorasync) events of the [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object. 
1. Starts processing events by invoking the [StartProcessingAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.startprocessingasync) on the [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object. 
1. Stops processing events after 30 seconds by invoking [StopProcessingAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.stopprocessingasync) on the [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object.
   
In the code sample below, replace the `<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>` and `<BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME>` placeholder values for the `BlobContainerClient` URI. Replace the `<EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE>` and `<HUB_NAME>` placeholder values for the `EventProcessorClient` as well.

```csharp
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Consumer;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using System.Text;

// Create a blob container client that the event processor will use
// TODO: Replace the <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> placeholder value
BlobContainerClient storageClient = new BlobContainerClient(
    new Uri("https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/<BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME>"),,
    new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Create an event processor client to process events in the event hub
// TODO: Replace the <EVENT_HUBS_NAMESPACE> and <HUB_NAME> placeholder values
var processor = new EventProcessorClient(
    storageClient,
    EventHubConsumerClient.DefaultConsumerGroupName,
    "<EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE>.servicebus.windows.net",
    "<HUB_NAME>",
    new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Register handlers for processing events and handling errors
processor.ProcessEventAsync += ProcessEventHandler;
processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ProcessErrorHandler;

// Start the processing
await processor.StartProcessingAsync();

// Wait for 30 seconds for the events to be processed
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

// Stop the processing
await processor.StopProcessingAsync();

async Task ProcessEventHandler(ProcessEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    // Write the body of the event to the console window
    Console.WriteLine("\tReceived event: {0}", Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventArgs.Data.Body.ToArray()));

    // Update checkpoint in the blob storage so that the app receives only new events the next time it's run
    await eventArgs.UpdateCheckpointAsync(eventArgs.CancellationToken);
}

Task ProcessErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    // Write details about the error to the console window
    Console.WriteLine($"\tPartition '{eventArgs.PartitionId}': an unhandled exception was encountered. This was not expected to happen.");
    Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.Exception.Message);
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

## [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

Here are the important steps from the code:

1. Creates an [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object using the primary connection string to the namespace and the event hub. You need to build [BlobContainerClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobcontainerclient) object for the container in the Azure storage you created earlier.
1. Specifies handlers for the [ProcessEventAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.processeventasync) and [ProcessErrorAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.processerrorasync) events of the [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object. 
1. Starts processing events by invoking the [StartProcessingAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.startprocessingasync) on the [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object. 
1. Stops processing events after 30 seconds by invoking [StopProcessingAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.stopprocessingasync) on the [EventProcessorClient](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient) object.
   
In the code sample below, replace the `<AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING>` and `<BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME>` placeholder values for the `BlobContainerClient` URI. Replace the `<EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE_CONNECTION_STRING>` and `<HUB_NAME>` placeholder values for the `EventProcessorClient` as well.

```csharp
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Consumer;
using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using System.Text;

// Create a blob container client that the event processor will use 
BlobContainerClient storageClient = new BlobContainerClient(
    "<AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING>", "<BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME>");

// Create an event processor client to process events in the event hub
var processor = new EventProcessorClient(
    storageClient,
    EventHubConsumerClient.DefaultConsumerGroupName,
    "<EVENT_HUBS_NAMESPACE_CONNECTION_STRING>",
    "<HUB_NAME>");

// Register handlers for processing events and handling errors
processor.ProcessEventAsync += ProcessEventHandler;
processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ProcessErrorHandler;

// Start the processing
await processor.StartProcessingAsync();

// Wait for 30 seconds for the events to be processed
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

// Stop the processing
await processor.StopProcessingAsync();

async Task ProcessEventHandler(ProcessEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    // Write the body of the event to the console window
    Console.WriteLine("\tReceived event: {0}", Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventArgs.Data.Body.ToArray()));

    // Update checkpoint in the blob storage so that the app receives only new events the next time it's run
    await eventArgs.UpdateCheckpointAsync(eventArgs.CancellationToken);
}

Task ProcessErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    // Write details about the error to the console window
    Console.WriteLine($"\tPartition '{eventArgs.PartitionId}': an unhandled exception was encountered. This was not expected to happen.");
    Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.Exception.Message);
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

1. Build the project, and ensure that there are no errors.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the complete source code with more informational comments, see [this file on the GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/samples/Sample01_HelloWorld.md).
6. Run the receiver application. 
1. You should see a message that the events have been received. 

    ```bash
    Received event: Event 1
    Received event: Event 2
    Received event: Event 3    
    ```
    These events are the three events you sent to the event hub earlier by running the sender program. 
1. In the Azure portal, you can verify that there are 3 outgoing messages. These are the messages Event Hubs sent to the receiving application. Refresh the page to update the chart. It may take a few seconds for it to show that the messages have been received.
