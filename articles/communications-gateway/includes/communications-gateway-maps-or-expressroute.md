- In most cases, we recommend using Microsoft Azure Peering Service (MAPS) to connect your network to Azure Communications Gateway.
- Alternatively, you can use an Azure ExpressRoute circuit to achieve Microsoft Peering and connect your network to Azure Communications Gateway. For more information, and examples of why you might want to use ExpressRoute Microsoft Peering, see [Using ExpressRoute for Microsoft PSTN Services](/azure/expressroute/using-expressroute-for-microsoft-pstn).
