# Get started with Azure Communications Gateway

Setting up Azure Communications Gateway requires planning your deployment, deploying your Azure Communications Gateway resource, and integrating with Operator Connect or Teams Phone Mobile.

This article summarizes the steps and documentation that you need.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must fully understand the onboarding process for your chosen communications service and any dependencies introduced by the onboarding process. For advice, ask your onboarding team.
>
> Some steps in the deployment and integration process can require days or weeks to complete. For example, you might need to arrange Microsoft Azure Peering Service (MAPS) connectivity before you can deploy, wait for onboarding, or wait for a specific date to launch your service. We recommend that you read through any documentation from your onboarding team and the procedures in [2. Deploy Azure Communications Gateway](#2-deploy-azure-communications-gateway) and [3.
