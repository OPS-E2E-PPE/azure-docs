## Configuring the backup job for Azure Files

### Why can't I see some of my Azure file shares in the Storage Account when I'm trying to configure backup? <br/>

During the preview, you can protect Azure file shares from up to 25 Storage Accounts per Vault. You can also protect up to 200 Azure file shares in a single vault. 

## Backup

### How many On-Demand backups can I take per file share? <br/>
At any point in time, you can have up to 200 Snapshots for a file share. The limit includes snapshots taken by Azure Backup as defined by your policy. If your backups start failing after reaching the limit, delete On-Demand restore points for successful future backups.

### After enabling Virtual Networks on my Storage Account, the Backup of file shares in the account started failing. Why?
Backup for Azure file shares does not support Storage Accounts that have Virtual Networks enabled. Disable Virtual Networks in Storage Accounts to enable successful backups. 

## Restore

### Can I recover from a deleted Azure file share? <br/>
When a Azure file share is deleted, you are shown the list of backups that will also be deleted and a confirmation is sought. A deleted Azure file share cannot be restored.

### Can I restore from backups if I stopped protection on an Azure file share? <br/>
Yes. If you chose **Retain Backup Data** when you stopped protection, then you can restore from all existing restore points.

## Manage Backup

### Can I access the snapshots taken by Azure Backups and mount it? <br/>
All Snapshots taken by Azure Backup can be accessed by Viewing Snapshots in the portal, PowerShell, or CLI. To learn more about Azure Files share snapshots, see [Overview of share snapshots for Azure Files (preview)](../storage/files/storage-snapshots-files.md).

### What is the maximum retention I can configure for Backups? <br/>
Backup for Azure file shares offers the ability to retain your daily backups up to 120 days.

### What happens when I change the Backup policy for an Azure file share? <br/>
When a new policy is applied on file share(s), schedule and retention of the new policy is followed. If retention is extended, existing recovery points are marked to keep them as per new policy. If retention is reduced, they are marked for pruning in the next cleanup job and subsequently deleted.
