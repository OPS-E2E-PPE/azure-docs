# Back up Azure VMs in a Recovery Services vault

This article describes how to back up Azure VMs in Recovery Services vaults with the [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md) service. 

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Verify support and prerequisites for backup.
> * Prepare Azure VMs. Install the Azure VM agent if needed, and verify outbound access for VMs.
> * Create a vault.
> * Discover VMs and configure a backup policy.
> * Enable backup for Azure VMs.


> [!NOTE]
   > This article describes how to set up a vault and select VMs to back up. It's useful if you want to back up multiple VMs. Alternatively you can [back up a single Azure VM](backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm.md) directly from the VM settings.

## Before you start


- [Review](backup-architecture.md#architecture-direct-backup-of-azure-vms) Azure VM backup architecture.
- [Learn about](backup-azure-vms-introduction.md) Azure VM backup, and the backup extension.
- [Review the support matrix](backup-support-matrix-iaas.md) for Azure VM backup.


## Prepare Azure VMs

In some circumstances you might need to set up the Azure VM agent on Azure VMs, or explicitly allow outbound access on the VM.

### Install the VM agent 

Azure Backup backs up Azure VMs by installing an extension to the Azure VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure marketplace image, the agent is installed and running. If you create a custom VM, or you migrate an on-premises machine, you might need to install the agent manually, as summarized in the table.

**VM** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Windows VMs** | 1. [Download and install](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409) the agent MSI file.<br/><br/> 2. Install with admin permissions on the machine.<br/><br/> 3. Verify the installation. In *C:\WindowsAzure\Packages* on the VM, right-click the WaAppAgent.exe > **Properties**, > **Details** tab. **Product Version** should be 2.6.1198.718 or higher.<br/><br/> If you're updating the agent, make sure no backup operations are running, and [reinstall the agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409).
**Linux VMs** | Install using an RPM or a DEB package from your distribution's package repository. This is the preferred method for installing and upgrading the Azure Linux Agent. All the [endorsed distribution providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) integrate the Azure Linux agent package into their images and repositories. The agent is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent), but we don't recommend installing from there.<br/><br/> If you're updating the agent, make sure no backup operations are running, and update the binaries.


### Establish network connectivity

The Backup extension running on the VM needs outbound access to Azure public IP addresses.

- Generally you don't need to explicitly allow outbound network access for an Azure VM in order for it to communicate with Azure Backup.
- If you do run into difficulties with VMs connecting, and if you see the error **ExtensionSnapshotFailedNoNetwork** when attempting to connect, you should explicitly allow access so the backup extension can communicate to Azure public IP addresses for backup traffic.


#### Explicitly allow outbound access

If your VM can't connect to the Backup service, explicitly allow outbound access using one of the methods summarized in the table.

**Option** | **Action** | **Details** 
--- | --- | --- 
**Set up NSG rules** | Allow the [Azure datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653). | Instead of allowing and managing every address range, you can add a rule that allows access to the Azure Backup service using a [service tag](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md#set-up-an-nsg-rule-to-allow-outbound-access-to-azure). [Learn more](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags).<br/><br/> No additional costs.<br/><br/> Simple to manage with service tags.
**Deploy a proxy** | Deploy an HTTP proxy server for routing traffic. | Provides access to the whole of Azure, and not just storage.<br/><br/> Granular control over the storage URLs is allowed.<br/><br/> Single point of internet access for VMs.<br/><br/> Additional costs for proxy.
**Set up Azure Firewall** | Allow traffic through the Azure Firewall on the VM, using an FQDN tag for the Azure Backup service. |  Simple to use if you have Azure Firewall set up in a VNet subnet<br/><br/> You can't create your own FQDN tags, or modify FQDNs in a tag.<br/><br/> If you use Azure Managed Disks, you might need an additional port opening (port 8443) on the firewalls.

##### Set up an NSG rule to allow outbound access to Azure

If the VM access is managed by an NSG, allow outbound access for the backup storage, to the required ranges and ports.

1. In the VM properties > **Networking**, click **Add outbound port rule**.
2. In **Add outbound security rule**, click **Advanced**.
3. In **Source**, select **VirtualNetwork**.
4. In **Source port ranges**, type in an asterisk (*) to allow outbound access from any port.
5. In **Destination**, select **Service Tag**. From the list, select **Storage.region**. The region is the region in which the vault, and the VMs you want to back up, are located.
6. In **Destination port ranges**, select the port.
    - Unmanaged VM with unencrypted storage account: 80
    - Unmanaged VM with encrypted storage account: 443 (default setting)
    - Managed VM: 8443.
7. In **Protocol**, select **TCP**.
8. In **Priority**, specify a priority value less than any higher deny rules.
   - If you have a rule denying access, the new allow rule must be higher.
   - For example, if you have a **Deny_All** rule set at priority 1000, your new rule must be set to less than 1000.
9. Provide a name and description for the rule, and click **OK**.

You can apply the NSG rule to multiple VMs to allow outbound access. This video walks you through the process.

##### Route backup traffic through a proxy

You can route backup traffic through a proxy, and then give the proxy access to the required Azure ranges. Configure the proxy VM to allow the following:

- The Azure VM should route all HTTP traffic bound for the public internet through the proxy.
- The proxy should allow incoming traffic from VMs in the applicable virtual network (VNet).
- The NSG **NSF-lockdown** needs a rule that allows outbound internet traffic from the proxy VM.

###### Set up the proxy

If you don't have a system account proxy, set one up as follows:

1. Download [PsExec](https://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/bb897553).
2. Run **PsExec.exe -i -s cmd.exe** to run the command prompt under a system account.
3. Run the browser in system context. For example: **%PROGRAMFILES%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe** for Internet Explorer.  
4. Define the proxy settings.
   - On Linux machines:
     - Add this line to the **/etc/environment** file:
       - **http_proxy=http:\//proxy IP address:proxy port**
     - Add these lines to the **/etc/waagent.conf** file:
         - **HttpProxy.Host=proxy IP address**
         - **HttpProxy.Port=proxy port**
   - On Windows machines, in the browser settings, specify that a proxy should be used. If you're currently using a proxy on a user account, you can use this script to apply the setting at the system account level.
       ```powershell
      $obj = Get-ItemProperty -Path Registry::”HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections"
      Set-ItemProperty -Path Registry::”HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections" -Name DefaultConnectionSettings -Value $obj.DefaultConnectionSettings
      Set-ItemProperty -Path Registry::”HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections" -Name SavedLegacySettings -Value $obj.SavedLegacySettings
      $obj = Get-ItemProperty -Path Registry::”HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"
      Set-ItemProperty -Path Registry::”HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" -Name ProxyEnable -Value $obj.ProxyEnable
      Set-ItemProperty -Path Registry::”HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" -Name Proxyserver -Value $obj.Proxyserver

       ```

###### Allow incoming connections on the proxy

Allow incoming connections in the proxy settings.

1, In Windows Firewall, open **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.
2. Right-click **Inbound Rules** > **New Rule**.
3. In **Rule Type** select **Custom** > **Next**.
4. In **Program**, select **All Programs** > **Next**.
5. In **Protocols and Ports**:
   - Set the type to **TCP**
   - Set **Local Ports** to **Specific Ports**
   - Set **Remote port** to **All Ports**.
  
6. Finish the wizard and specify a name for the rule.

###### Add an exception rule to the NSG for the proxy

On the NSG **NSF-lockdown**, allow traffic from any port on 10.0.0.5 to any internet address on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

- The following PowerShell script provides an example for allowing traffic.
- Instead of allowing outbound to all public internet addresses, you can specify an IP address range (-DestinationPortRange), or use the storage.region service tag.   

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "NSG-lockdown" |
    Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule -Name "allow-proxy " -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -Type Outbound -Priority 200 -SourceAddressPrefix "10.0.0.5/32" -SourcePortRange "*" -DestinationAddressPrefix Internet -DestinationPortRange "80-443"
    ```

### Allow firewall access with FQDN tag

You can set up the Azure Firewall to allow outbound access for network traffic to Azure Backup.

- [Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal) deploying Azure Firewall.
- [Read about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/fqdn-tags) FQDN tags.

## Modify storage replication settings

By default, your vault has [geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs).

- We recommend GRS for your primary backup.
- You can use [locally-redundant storage (LRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) for a cheaper option.

Modify storage replication type as follows:

1. In the portal, click the new vault. Under the **Settings** section, click  **Properties**.
2. In **Properties**, under **Backup Configuration**, click **Update**.
3. Select the storage replication type, and click **Save**.

      ![Set the storage configuration for new vault](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/full-blade.png)


## Configure a backup policy

Discover VMs in the subscription, and configure backup.

1. In the vault > **Overview**, click **+Backup**

   ![Backup button](./media/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare/backup-button.png)

   The **Backup** and **Backup Goal** panes open.

2. In **Backup Goal**> **Where is your workload running?**, select **Azure**. In **What do you want to backup?**, select **Virtual machine** >  **OK**. This registers the VM extension in the vault.

   ![Backup and Backup Goal panes](./media/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare/select-backup-goal-1.png)

   This step registers the VM extension with the vault. The **Backup Goal** pane closes, and the **Backup policy** pane opens.

3. In **Backup policy**, select the policy that you want to associate with the vault. Then click **OK**.
    - The details of the default policy are listed under the drop-down menu.
    - Click **Create New** to create a policy. [Learn more](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md#configure-a-backup-policy) about defining a policy.

      !["Backup" and "Backup policy" panes](./media/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare/select-backup-goal-2.png)

4. In **Select virtual machines** pane, select the VMs that will use the specified backup policy > **OK**.

   - The selected VM is validated.
   - You can only select VMs in the same region as the vault. VMs can only be backed up in a single vault.

     !["Select virtual machines" pane](./media/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare/select-vms-to-backup.png)

5. In **Backup**, select **Enable backup**.

   - This deploys the policy to the vault and to the VMs, and installs the backup extension on the VM agent running on the Azure VM.
   - This step doesn't create the initial recovery point for the VM.

     !["Enable backup" button](./media/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare/vm-validated-click-enable.png)

After enabling backup:

- An initial backup runs in accordance with your backup schedule.
- The Backup service installs the backup extension whether or not the VM is running.
    - A running VM provides the greatest chance of getting an application-consistent recovery point.
    -  However, the VM is backed up even if it's turned off and the extension can't be installed. It's known as an offline VM. In this case, the recovery point will be crash-consistent.
    Note that Azure Backup doesn't support automatic clock adjustment for daylight-saving changes for Azure VM backups. Modify backup policies manually as required.

## Run the initial backup

The initial backup will run in accordance with the schedule unless you manually run it immediately. Run it manually as follows:

1. In the vault menu, click **Backup items**.
2. In **Backup Items** click **Azure Virtual Machine**.
3. In the **Backup Items** list, click the ellipses **...**.
4. Click **Backup now**.
5. In **Backup Now**, use the calendar control to select the last day that the recovery point should be retained >  **OK**.
6. Monitor the portal notifications. You can monitor the job progress in the vault dashboard > **Backup Jobs** > **In progress**. Depending on the size of your VM, creating the initial backup may take a while.
