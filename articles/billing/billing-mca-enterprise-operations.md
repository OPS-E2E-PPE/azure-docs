# Complete Enterprise Agreement tasks in your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement

If your organization has signed a Microsoft Customer Agreement to renew your Enterprise Agreement enrollment, then you must set up the new billing account created for the agreement. Your new billing account provides you enhanced billing and cost management capabilities through a new streamlined, unified management experience. For more information, see [Set up your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement](billing-mca-setup-account.md).

Once the setup is completed, use this article to understand how to perform tasks that you performed in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment.

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

## Mapping of Enterprise Agreement's billing to the new billing account

The billing in your new account is organized differently than your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. The following table describes the mapping of billing from your Enterprise Agreement enrollment to your new billing account. To learn more about your new billing account, see [Get started with your billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement](billing-mca-overview.md).

| Enterprise Agreement   | Microsoft Customer Agreement    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Enrollment            | You use a billing profile to manage billing for your organization, similar to your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. Enterprise administrators become owners of the billing profile. To learn more about billing profiles, see [Understand billing profiles](billing-mca-overview.md#understand-billing-profiles).
| Department            | You use an invoice section to organize your costs, similar to departments in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. Department becomes invoice sections and department administrators become owners of the respective invoice sections. To learn more about invoice sections, see [Understand invoice sections](billing-mca-overview.md#understand-invoice-sections). |
| Account               | The accounts that were created in your Enterprise Agreement arenâ€™t supported in the new billing account. The account's subscriptions belong to the respective invoice section for their department. Account owners can create and manage subscriptions for their invoice sections. |

## Tasks performed by an enterprise administrator

If you are an enterprise administrator on an Enterprise Agreement that got renewed to a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you are assigned the following roles on the new billing account created for the agreement:

**Billing profile owner** - You are assigned the billing profile owner role on the billing profile that was created when the agreement was signed. The role lets you manage the billing for your organization. You can view charges and invoices, organize costs on the invoice, manage payment methods, and control access to your organization's billing.

**Invoice section owner** - You are assigned the invoice section owner role on all invoice sections that are created for the departments in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. The role lets you control who can create Azure subscriptions and purchase other products.

### View charges and credits balance for your organization

You use your billing profile to track charges and Azure credits balance for your organization similar to your Enterprise Agreement enrollment.

To learn how to view credit balance for a billing profile, see [Track Azure credit balance for your billing profile](billing-mca-check-azure-credits-balance.md).

To learn how to view charges for a billing profile, see [Understand the charges on your Microsoft Customer Agreement's invoice](billing-mca-understand-your-bill.md).

An invoice section is created for each department you had in your Enterprise Agreement. You can view charges for an invoice section in the Azure portal. For more information, see [View transactions by invoice sections](billing-mca-understand-your-bill.md#view-transactions-by-invoice-sections).

### View charges for an account

The accounts that were created in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment are not supported in the new billing account. The account's subscriptions belong to the respective invoice section for their department. Account owners can create and manage subscriptions for their invoice sections.

To view aggregate cost for subscriptions that belonged to an account, you must set a cost center for each subscription. Then you can use the Azure usage and charges csv file to filter the subscriptions by the cost center.

### Download usage and charges csv, price sheet, and tax documents

A monthly invoice is generated for each billing profile in your billing account. For each invoice, you can download Azure usage and charges csv file, price sheet, and tax document (if applicable). You can also download Azure usage and charges csv file for the current month's charges.
