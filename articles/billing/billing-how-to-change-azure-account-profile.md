# Change your Azure account profile information

The email address in the Account Administrator’s profile is used by Microsoft to notify you about important billing-related updates about the subscription. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that you check regularly. You can also update your profile to change your mailing address and phone number.

## Change your profile information

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.azure.com/Profile).
1. Select the **Edit details** button, and then update the **Profile** information.

### Send notifications to a different account

You can have notifications sent to a different email address other than the Account Administrator email address associated with your account. The email address on the account gets important notifications about all the subscriptions under the account. So we recommend that you specify a contact email address that the Account Administrator checks regularly.

### Change the Account Administrator email address in your profile

The Account Administrator is the person who set up the Azure account and who receives important email notifications about all the subscriptions under the account. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that the Account Administrator checks regularly.

### Updating your profile email doesn't update your sign-in email address

Updating the profile email address doesn't update your sign-in email address. To change your sign-in email address, you have to transfer ownership of the account.

### Updating your profile address doesn't update your credit card billing address

To learn how to update your billing information, see [Change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md).

### You can't update your country

Because of technical constraints, we cannot change the country for an existing account. However, you can create an account in the desired country and then contact Azure support to migrate your services to that account.

## Service and marketing emails

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you're prompted to update your email address every 90 days. The notification purpose is to ensure that Microsoft has updated contact information. Microsoft sends emails to your *contact address* with Azure account-related information for:

- Service notifications
- Security alerts
- Billing purposes
- Support
- Marketing communications
- Best practice recommendations, based on your Azure usage

Enter a preferred contact email address where you'll receive communications about your subscription. By entering an address, you're opting-in to receive communications from Microsoft.

### Change your contact email address

You can change your contact email address using the following methods:

**Option 1**: Go to the [Contact information](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/ContactInfoBlade) area in the Azure portal and enter an email address. The address you provide will receive service and marketing communications.

**Option 2**: In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/ContactInfoBlade), select the icon with your initials or picture. Then, select the context menu (**...**). Next, select **My Contact Information** from the menu and enter an email address. The address you provide will receive service and marketing communications.

### Opt-out of marketing emails

To opt-out of receiving marketing emails:

1. Open https://www.microsoft.com and click **Sign in** in the top right corner of the webpage to sign-in to your Microsoft account.
2. After you sign-in, open https://account.microsoft.com/profile/communications.
3. Your account page shows the types of marketing communications that you are opted-in to. Clear any topics that you want to opt-out of and then click **Save**.

### You still receive service notifications if you opt-out of marketing communications

If you provided an email address for communications, you will receive service notifications, based on your account. When you opt-out, you only opt-out of marketing communications—you still receive service notifications.
