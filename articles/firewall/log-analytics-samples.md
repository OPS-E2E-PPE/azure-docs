```
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "AzureFirewallApplicationRule"
| where msg_s !contains "SNI TLS extension was missing" 
| parse msg_s with Protocol "request from" SourceIP ":" SourcePort:int " to" TargetURL ":" TargetPort:int ". Action:" Action "." *
| parse msg_s with * ". Rule Collection:" UserRuleCollection ". Rule:" UserRule
| parse msg_s with * "No rule matched. Proceeding with" DefaultRule
| extend Rule = case(DefaultRule == "", UserRule, DefaultRule), RuleCollection = case(UserRuleCollection == "", DefaultRule, UserRuleCollection)
| project TimeGenerated,msg_s, Protocol, Action, SourceIP, tostring(SourcePort), TargetURL, tostring(TargetPort), RuleCollection, Rule
```

## Network rules

```
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "AzureFirewallNetworkRule"
| parse msg_s with Protocol "request from" SourceIP ":" SourcePort:int " to" TargetIP ":" TargetPort:int *
| parse msg_s with * ". Action:" fw_Action
| parse msg_s with * "was" nat_Action
| extend Action = case(fw_Action == "", nat_Action, fw_Action)
