# Troubleshoot guide for Caching for ACR (Preview)

This article is part four in a four-part tutorial series. [Part one](tutorial-registry-cache.md) provides information about the Caching for ACR (preview) feature, its limitations, and benefits of the implementation in your registry. In [part two](tutorial-enable-registry-cache.md), you learn how to enable Caching for ACR (preview) feature by using the Azure portal. In [part three](tutorial-enable-registry-cache-auth.md), you learn how to enable Caching for ACR feature with authentication by using the Azure portal.

This article helps you troubleshoot problems you might encounter when attempting to use Caching for ACR (preview).

## Symptoms and Causes

May include one or more of the following issues: 

- Cached images don't appear in a real repository 
  - [Cached images don't appear in a live repository](tutorial-troubleshoot-registry-cache.md#cached-images-dont-appear-in-a-live-repository) 

- Credential set has an unhealthy status
  - [Unhealthy Credential Set](tutorial-troubleshoot-registry-cache.md#unhealthy-credential-set)

- Unable to create a cache rule
  - [Unsupported Registries](tutorial-troubleshoot-registry-cache.md#unsupported-registries)
  - [Cache rule Limit](tutorial-troubleshoot-registry-cache.md#cache-rule-limit)

## Potential Solutions

## Cached images don't appear in a live repository 

If you're having an issue with cached images not showing up in your repository in ACR, we recommend verifying the repository path. Incorrect repository paths lead the cached images to not show up in your repository in ACR. Caching for ACR currently supports **Docker Hub** and **Microsoft Artifact Registry**.  

- The Login server for Docker Hub is `docker.io`.
- The Login server for Microsoft Artifact Registry is `mcr.microsoft.com`.

The Azure portal autofills these fields for you. However, many Docker repositories begin with `library/` in their path. For example, in-order to cache the `hello-world` repository, the correct Repository Path is `docker.io/library/hello-world`. 

## Unhealthy Credential Set

Credential sets are a set of Key Vault secrets that operate as a Username and Password for private repositories. Unhealthy Credential sets are often a result of these secrets no longer being valid. Inside the Azure portal you can select the credential set, to edit and apply changes.

- Verify the secrets in Azure Key Vault haven't expired. 
- Verify the secrets in Azure Key Vault are valid.
- Verify the access to the Azure Key Vault is assigned.

To assign the access to Azure Key Vault:

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault set-policy --name myKeyVaultName --object-id myObjID --secret-permissions get
```

## Unable to create a Cache rule

### Unsupported Registries 

If you're facing issues while creating a Cache rule, we recommend verifying if you're attempting to cache repositories from an unsupported registry. ACR currently supports **Docker Hub** and **Microsoft Artifact Registry** for Caching.

- The repository path for Docker is `docker.io/library`
- The repository path for Microsoft Artifact Registry is `mcr.microsoft.com/library`

### Cache rule Limit

If you're facing issues while creating a Cache rule, we recommend verifying if you've more than 50 cache rules created. 

We recommend deleting any unwanted cache rules to avoid hitting the limit.
