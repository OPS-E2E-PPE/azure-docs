# Persist files in Azure Cloud Shell
Cloud Shell takes advantage of Azure File storage to persist files across sessions.

## Set up a `clouddrive` file share
On initial start, Cloud Shell prompts you to associate a new or existing file share to persist files across sessions.

### Create new storage

When you use basic settings and select only a subscription, Cloud Shell creates three resources on your behalf in the supported region that's nearest to you:
* Resource group: `cloud-shell-storage-<region>`
* Storage account: `cs-uniqueGuid`
* File share: `cs-<user>-<domain>-com-uniqueGuid`

The file share mounts as `clouddrive` in your `$Home` directory. The file share is also used to store a 5-GB image that's created for you and that automatically updates and persists your `$Home` directory. This is a one-time action, and the file share mounts automatically in subsequent sessions.

### Use existing resources

By using the advanced option, you can associate existing resources. When the storage setup prompt appears, select **Show advanced settings** to view additional options. Existing file shares receive a 5-GB user image to persist your `$Home` directory. The drop-down menus are filtered for your assigned Cloud Shell region and the locally redundant storage and geo-redundant storage accounts.

### Restrict resource creation with an Azure resource policy
Storage accounts that you create in Cloud Shell are tagged with `ms-resource-usage:azure-cloud-shell`. If you want to disallow users from creating storage accounts in Cloud Shell, create an [Azure resource policy for tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-policy-tags) that are triggered by this specific tag.

## How Cloud Shell works
Cloud Shell persists files through both of the following methods:
* Creating a disk image of your `$Home` directory to persist all contents within the directory. The disk image is saved in your specified file share as `acc_<User>.img` at `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare/.cloudconsole/acc_<User>.img`, and it automatically syncs changes.

* Mounting your specified file share as `clouddrive` in your `$Home` directory for direct file-share interaction. `/Home/<User>/clouddrive` is mapped to `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare`.
 
> [!NOTE]
> All files in your `$Home` directory, such as SSH keys, are persisted in your user disk image, which is stored in your mounted file share. Apply best practices when you persist information in your `$Home` directory and mounted file share.

## Use the `clouddrive` command
With Cloud Shell, you can run a command called `clouddrive`, which enables you to manually update the file share that's mounted to Cloud Shell.

## Mount a new `clouddrive`

### Prerequisites for manual mounting
You can update the file share that's associated with Cloud Shell by using the `clouddrive mount` command.

If you mount an existing file share, the storage accounts must be:
* Locally redundant storage or geo-redundant storage to support file shares.
* Located in your assigned region. When you are onboarding, the region you are assigned to is listed in the resource group name `cloud-shell-storage-<region>`.

### Supported storage regions
The Azure files must reside in the same region as the Cloud Shell machine that you're mounting them to. Cloud Shell machines exist in the following regions:
|Area|Region|
|---|---|
|Americas|East US, South Central US, West US|
|Europe|North Europe, West Europe|
|Asia Pacific|India Central, Southeast Asia|

### The `clouddrive mount` command

> [!NOTE]
> If you're mounting a new file share, a new user image is created for your `$Home` directory, because your previous `$Home` image is kept in the previous file share.

Run the `clouddrive mount` command with the following parameters:

```
clouddrive mount -s mySubscription -g myRG -n storageAccountName -f fileShareName
```

To view more details, run `clouddrive mount -h`, as shown here:

![Running the `clouddrive mount`command](media/mount-h.png)

## Unmount `clouddrive`
You can unmount a file share that's mounted to Cloud Shell at any time. However, because Cloud Shell requires a mounted file share, you will be prompted to create and mount a new file share at the next session if it has been removed.

To remove a file share from Cloud Shell:
1. Run `clouddrive unmount`.
2. Acknowledge and confirm the prompts.

Your file share will continue to exist unless you delete it manually. Cloud Shell will no longer search for this file share on subsequent sessions.

To view more details, run `clouddrive unmount -h`, as shown here:

![Running the `clouddrive unmount`command](media/unmount-h.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Although running this command will not delete any resources, manually deleting a resource group, storage account, or file share that's mapped to Cloud Shell will erase your `$Home` directory disk image and any files in your file share. This action cannot be undone.

## List `clouddrive` file shares
To discover which file share is mounted as `clouddrive`, run the following `df` command. 

The file path to clouddrive will show your storage account name and file share in the URL. For example, `//storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename`

```
justin@Azure:~$ df
Filesystem                                          1K-blocks   Used  Available Use% Mounted on

justin@Azure:~$
```

## Transfer local files to Cloud Shell
The `clouddrive` directory syncs with the Azure portal storage blade. Use this blade to transfer local files to or from your file share. Updating files from within Cloud Shell is reflected in the file storage GUI when you refresh the blade.

### Download files

![List of local files](media/download.png)
1. In the Azure portal, go to the mounted file share.
2. Select the target file.
3. Select the **Download** button.

### Upload files

![Local files to be uploaded](media/upload.png)
1. Go to your mounted file share.
2. Select the **Upload** button.
3. Select the file or files that you want to upload.
4. Confirm the upload.

You should now see the files that are accessible in your `clouddrive` directory in Cloud Shell.
