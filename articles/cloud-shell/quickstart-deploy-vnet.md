# Deploy Azure Cloud Shell in a virtual network with quickstart templates

Before you can deploy Azure Cloud Shell in a virtual network (VNet) configuration using the
quickstart templates, there are several prerequisites to complete before running the templates.

This document guides you through the process to complete the configuration.

## Steps to deploy Azure Cloud Shell in a virtual network

This article walks you through the following steps to deploy Azure Cloud Shell in a virtual network:

1. Register resource providers
1. Collect the required information
1. Create the virtual networks using the **Azure Cloud Shell - VNet** ARM template
1. Create the virtual network storage account using the **Azure Cloud Shell - VNet storage** ARM
   template
1. Configure and use Azure Cloud Shell in a virtual network

## 1. Register resource providers

Azure Cloud Shell needs access to certain Azure resources. That access is made available through
resource providers. The following resource providers must be registered in your subscription:

- **Microsoft.CloudShell**
- **Microsoft.ContainerInstances**
- **Microsoft.Relay**

Depending when your tenant was created, some of these providers might already be registered.

To see all resource providers, and the registration status for your subscription:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][04].
1. On the Azure portal menu, search for **Subscriptions**. Select it from the available options.
1. Select the subscription you want to view.
1. On the left menu, under **Settings**, select **Resource providers**.
1. In the search box, enter `cloudshell` to search for the resource provider.
1. Select the **Microsoft.CloudShell** resource provider register from the provider list.
1. Select **Register** to change the status from **unregistered** to **Registered**.
1. Repeat the previous steps for the **Microsoft.ContainerInstances** and **Microsoft.Relay**
   resource providers.

## 2. Collect the required information

There are several pieces of information that you need to collect before you can deploy Azure Cloud.
You can use the default Azure Cloud Shell instance to gather the required information and create the
necessary resources. You should create dedicated resources for the Azure Cloud Shell VNet
deployment. All resources must be in the same Azure region and contained in the same resource group.

- **Subscription** - The name of your subscription containing the resource group used for the Azure
  Cloud Shell VNet deployment
- **Resource Group** - The name of the resource group used for the Azure Cloud Shell VNet deployment
- **Region** - The location of the resource group
- **Virtual Network** - The name of the virtual network created for Azure Cloud Shell VNet
- **Azure Container Instance OID** - The ID of the Azure Container Instance for your resource group
- **Azure Relay Namespace** - The name that you want to assign to the Relay resource created by the
  template

### Create a resource group

You can create the resource group using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. For more
information, see the following articles:

- [Manage Azure resource groups by using the Azure portal][02]
- [Manage Azure resource groups by using Azure CLI][01]
- [Manage Azure resource groups by using Azure PowerShell][03]

### Create a virtual network

You can create the virtual network using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. For more
information, see the following articles:

- [Use the Azure portal to create a virtual network][05]
- [Use Azure PowerShell to create a virtual network][06]
- [Use Azure CLI to create a virtual network][04]

> [!NOTE]
> When setting the Container subnet address prefix for the Cloud Shell subnet it's important to
> consider the number of Cloud Shell sessions you need to run concurrently. If the number of Cloud
> Shell sessions exceeds the available IP addresses in the container subnet, users of those sessions
> can't connect to Cloud Shell. Increase the container subnet range to accommodate your specific
> needs. For more information, see the _Change Network Settings_ section of
> [Add, change, or delete a virtual network subnet][07]

### Azure Container Instance ID

The **Azure Container Instance ID** is a unique value for every tenant. You use this identifier in
the [quickstart templates][07] to configure virtual network for Cloud Shell.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][09]. From the **Home** screen, select **Microsoft Entra ID**. If
   the icon isn't displayed, enter `Microsoft Entra ID` in the top search bar.
1. In the left menu, select **Overview** and enter `azure container instance service` into the
   search bar.

   [![Screenshot of searching for Azure Container Instance Service.][95]][95a]

1. In the results under **Enterprise applications**, select the **Azure Container Instance Service**.
1. Find **ObjectID** listed as a property on the **Overview** page for **Azure Container Instance
   Service**.
1. You use this ID in the quickstart template for virtual network.

## 3. Create the virtual network using the ARM template

Use the [Azure Cloud Shell - VNet][08] template to create Cloud Shell resources in a virtual
network. The template creates three subnets under the virtual network created earlier. You might
choose to change the supplied names of the subnets or use the defaults. The virtual network, along
with the subnets, require valid IP address assignments. You need at least one IP address for the
Relay subnet and enough IP addresses in the container subnet to support the number of concurrent
sessions you expect to use.

The ARM template requires specific information about the resources you created earlier, along with
naming information for new resources. This information is filled out along with the prefilled
information in the form.

Information needed for the template:

- **Subscription** - The name of your subscription containing the resource group for Azure Cloud
  Shell VNet
- **Resource Group** - The resource group name of either an existing or newly created resource group
- **Region** - Location of the resource group
- **Virtual Network** - The name of the virtual network created for Azure Cloud Shell virtual network
- **Network Security Group** - The name that you want to assign to the Network Security Group
  created by the template
- **Azure Container Instance OID** - The ID of the Azure Container Instance for your resource group

Fill out the form with the following information:

Once the form is complete, select **Review + Create** and deploy the network ARM template to your
subscription.

## 5. Configuring Cloud Shell to use a virtual network

After you have deployed your private Cloud Shell instance, each Cloud Shell user must change their
configuration to use the new private instance.

If you have used the default Cloud Shell before deploying the private instance, you must reset your
user settings.

1. Open Cloud Shell
1. Select **Cloud Shell settings** from the menu bar (gear icon).
1. Select **Reset user settings** then select **Reset**

Resetting the user settings triggers the first-time user experience the next time you start Cloud
Shell.

[![Screenshot of Cloud Shell storage dialog box.][97]][97a]

1. Choose your preferred shell experience (Bash or PowerShell)
1. Select **Show advanced settings**
1. Select the **Show VNET isolation settings** checkbox.
1. Choose the **Subscription** containing your private Cloud Shell instance.
1. Choose the **Region** containing your private Cloud Shell instance.
1. Select the **Resource group** name containing your private Cloud Shell instance. If you have
   selected the correct resource group, the **Virtual network**, **Network profile**, and **Relay
   namespace** should be automatically populated with the correct values.
1. Enter the name for the **File share** you created with the storage template.
1. Select **Create storage**.

## Next steps

You must complete the Cloud Shell configuration steps for each user that needs to use the new
private Cloud Shell instance.
