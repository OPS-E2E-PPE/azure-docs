## Ensure that Azure Dev Spaces was successfully enabled on the cluster

In the previous section, you ran the `azds resource create` command to create a new Azure Dev Spaces resource. It can take some time to complete, so check back that it was successfully created. You can always check the environments you have access to, and their status, with this command: `azds resource list`.
