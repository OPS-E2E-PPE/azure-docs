# Modify the local access configuration in a site

Access to the [distributed tracing](distributed-tracing.md) and [packet core dashboards](packet-core-dashboards.md) is secured by HTTPS. You can use a self-signed certificate or provide your own to authenticate access to your local diagnostics tools. We recommend providing a certificate signed by a globally known and trusted certificate authority (CA) for additional security in your deployment.

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to use the Azure portal to change the certificate used for securing access to a site's local monitoring tools.

## Prerequisites

- If you want to add or update a custom HTTPS certificate for accessing your local monitoring tools, you'll need a certificate signed by a globally known and trusted CA. Your certificate must use a private key of type RSA or EC to ensure it's exportable (see [Exportable or non-exportable key](../key-vault/certificates/about-certificates.md) for more information).
- Refer to [Collect local monitoring values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-local-monitoring-values) to collect the required values and make sure they're in the correct format.
- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you used to create your private mobile network. This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.

## View the local access configuration

In this step, you'll navigate to the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource representing your packet core instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for and select the **Mobile Network** resource representing the private mobile network.

1. In the resource menu, select **Sites**.
1. Select the site containing the packet core instance you want to modify.
1. Under the **Network function** heading, select the name of the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource shown next to **Packet Core**.

1. Check the fields under the **Local access** heading to view the current local access configuration and status.

## Modify the local access configuration

1. Select **Modify local access**.

1. Under **HTTPS certificate**, choose whether you want to provide a custom HTTPS certificate for accessing your local monitoring tools.
1. If you selected **Yes** for **Provide custom HTTPS certificate?**, use the information you collected in [Collect local monitoring values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-local-monitoring-values) to select a certificate.

    :::image type="content" source="media//modify-local-access-configuration/local-access-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Local access configuration tab.":::

1. Select **Next**. 
1. Azure will now validate the configuration values you entered. You should see a message indicating that your values have passed validation.

    :::image type="content" source="media//modify-local-access-configuration/modify-local-access-validation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing successful validation for a local access configuration change.":::

1. Select **Create**.
1. Azure will now redeploy the packet core instance with the new configuration. The Azure portal will display a confirmation screen when this deployment is complete.
1. Select **Go to resource**. Check that the fields under **Local access** contain the updated certificate information and successful provisioned status.
1. If you added or updated a custom HTTPS certificate, follow [Access the distributed tracing web GUI](distributed-tracing.md#access-the-distributed-tracing-web-gui) and [Access the packet core dashboards](packet-core-dashboards.md#access-the-packet-core-dashboards) to check if your browser trusts the connection to your local monitoring tools. Note that:
    
    - It may take up to four hours for the changes in the Key Vault to synchronize with the edge location.
    - You may need to clear your browser cache to observe the changes.
