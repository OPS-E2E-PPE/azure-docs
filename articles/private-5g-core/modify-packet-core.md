# Modify the packet core instance in a site

Each Azure Private 5G Core Preview site contains a packet core instance, which is a cloud-native implementation of the 3GPP standards-defined 5G Next Generation Core (5G NGC or 5GC). In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to modify a packet core instance using the Azure portal; this includes modifying the packet core's custom location, connected Azure Stack Edge device, and access network configuration. You'll also learn how to modify the data network attached to the packet core instance.

## Prerequisites

- If you want to make changes to the packet core configuration or access network, refer to [Collect packet core configuration values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-packet-core-configuration-values) and [Collect access network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-access-network-values) to collect the new values and make sure they're in the correct format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't update a packet core instance's **Technology type** or **Version** field.
    >
    > - To change the technology type, you'll need to delete the site and [recreate it](create-a-site.md). <!-- link to new site deletion section -->
    > - To change the version, [upgrade the packet core instance](upgrade-packet-core-azure-portal.md).

- If you want to make changes to the attached data network, refer to [Collect data network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-data-network-values) to collect the new values and make sure they're in the correct format.
- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you used to create your private mobile network. This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.

## Select the packet core instance to modify

In this step, you'll navigate to the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource representing your packet core instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for and select the **Mobile Network** resource representing the private mobile network.

3. In the **Resource** menu, select **Sites**.
4. Select the site containing the packet core instance you want to modify.
5. Under the **Network function** heading, select the name of the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource shown next to **Packet Core**.

6. Select **Modify packet core**.

7. If you want to make changes to the packet core configuration or access network values, go to [Modify the packet core configuration](#modify-the-packet-core-configuration). If you only want to make changes to the attached data network, go to [Modify the attached data network configuration](#modify-the-attached-data-network-configuration).

### Modify the packet core configuration

To modify the packet core and/or access network configuration:

1. In the **Configuration** tab, fill out the fields with any new values.
  
   - Use the information you collected in [Collect packet core configuration values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-packet-core-configuration-values) for the top-level configuration values.
   - Use the information you collected in [Collect access network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-access-network-values) for the configuration values under **Access network**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/modify-packet-core/modify-packet-core-configuration-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Modify packet core Configuration tab.":::

2. If you also want to make changes to the attached data network, select the **Data network** tab and go to [Modify the attached data network configuration](#modify-the-attached-data-network-configuration). Otherwise, go to [Submit and verify changes](#submit-and-verify-changes).

### Modify the attached data network configuration

To make changes to the data network attached to your packet core instance:

1. In the **Data network** tab, select the data network.

    :::image type="content" source="media/modify-packet-core/modify-packet-core-data-network-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Modify packet core Data network tab.":::

2. Use the information you collected in [Collect data network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-data-network-values) to fill out the fields in the **Modify a data network** window.

    :::image type="content" source="media/modify-packet-core/modify-packet-core-modify-data-network.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Attach data network screen.":::

3. Select **Modify**. You should see your changes under the **Data network** tab.

### Submit and verify changes

1. Select **Modify**.
2. Azure will now redeploy the packet core instance with the new configuration. The Azure portal will display the following confirmation screen when this deployment is complete.

    :::image type="content" source="media/site-deployment-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the confirmation of a successful deployment of a packet core instance.":::

3. Navigate to the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource as described in [Select the packet core instance to modify](#select-the-packet-core-instance-to-modify).

    - If you made changes to the packet core configuration, check that the fields under **Connected ASE device**, **Custom ARC location** and **Access network** contain the updated information.
    - If you made changes to the attached data network, check that the fields under **Data network** contain the updated information.

## Next steps

Use Log Analytics or the packet core dashboards to confirm your packet core instance is operating normally after you modify it.
