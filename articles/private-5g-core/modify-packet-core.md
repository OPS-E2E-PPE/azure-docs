# Modify the packet core instance in a site

Each Azure Private 5G Core Preview site contains a packet core instance, which is a cloud-native implementation of the 3GPP standards-defined 5G Next Generation Core (5G NGC or 5GC). In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to modify a packet core instance using the Azure portal; this includes modifying the packet core's custom location, connected Azure Stack Edge device, and access network configuration. You'll also learn how to add and modify the data networks attached to the packet core instance.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you have configured or will configure your packet core to have more than one attached data network, you'll need to modify it without a custom location to avoid issues with your data networks.
>
> 1. Follow this how-to guide to modify your packet core instance with the following changes:
>
>    1. In [Modify the packet core configuration](#modify-the-packet-core-configuration), make a note of the custom location value in the **Custom ARC location** field.
>    1. Set the **Custom ARC location** field to **None**.
>    1. In [Submit and verify changes](#submit-and-verify-changes), the packet core will be redeployed at an uninstalled state with the new configuration.
>
> 2. Follow this how-to guide again to set the **Custom ARC location** field to the custom location value you noted down.

## Prerequisites

- If you want to make changes to the packet core configuration or access network, refer to [Collect packet core configuration values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-packet-core-configuration-values) and [Collect access network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-access-network-values) to collect the new values and make sure they're in the correct format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't update a packet core instance's **Technology type** or **Version** field.
    >
    > - To change the technology type, you'll need to [delete the site](delete-a-site.md) and [recreate it](create-a-site.md).
    > - To change the version, [upgrade the packet core instance](upgrade-packet-core-azure-portal.md).


- If you want to make changes to the attached data networks, refer to [Collect data network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-data-network-values) to collect the new values and make sure they're in the correct format.
- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you used to create your private mobile network. This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.

## Select the packet core instance to modify

In this step, you'll navigate to the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource representing your packet core instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for and select the **Mobile Network** resource representing the private mobile network.

7. Choose the next step:
   - If you want to make changes to the packet core configuration, access network values, or remove the custom location go to [Modify the packet core configuration](#modify-the-packet-core-configuration).
   - If you want to configure a new or existing data network and attach it to the packet core instance, go to [Attach a data network](#attach-a-data-network).
   - If you want to make changes to a data network that's already attached to the packet core instance, go to [Modify attached data network configuration](#modify-attached-data-network-configuration).

## Modify the packet core configuration

To modify the packet core and/or access network configuration:

1. If you haven't already, [select the packet core instance to modify](#select-the-packet-core-instance-to-modify).
2. In the **Configuration** tab, fill out the fields with any new values.
  
   - Use the information you collected in [Collect packet core configuration values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-packet-core-configuration-values) for the top-level configuration values.
   - Use the information you collected in [Collect access network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-access-network-values) for the configuration values under **Access network**.

3. Choose the next step:
   - If you've finished modifying the packet core instance, go to [Submit and verify changes](#submit-and-verify-changes).
   - If you want to configure a new or existing data network and attach it to the packet core instance, go to [Attach a data network](#attach-a-data-network).
   - If you want to make changes to a data network that's already attached to the packet core instance, go to [Modify attached data network configuration](#modify-attached-data-network-configuration).

## Attach a data network

To configure a new or existing data network and attach it to your packet core instance:

1. If you haven't already, [select the packet core instance to modify](#select-the-packet-core-instance-to-modify).
