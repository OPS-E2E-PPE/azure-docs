# Get resource changes

Resources get changed through the course of daily use, reconfiguration, and even redeployment.
Change can come from an individual or by an automated process. Most change is by design, but
sometimes it isn't. With the last seven days of changes, Resource configuration changes enables you to:

- Find when changes were detected on an Azure Resource Manager property
- For each resource change, see property change details
- Query changes at scale across your subscriptions, Management group, or tenant

Change detection and details are valuable for the following example scenarios:

- During incident management to understand _potentially_ related changes. Query for change events
  during a specific window of time and evaluate the change details.
- Keeping a Configuration Management Database, known as a CMDB, up-to-date. Instead of refreshing
  all resources and their full property sets on a scheduled frequency, only get what changed.
- Understanding what other properties may have been changed when a resource changed compliance
  state. Evaluation of these extra properties can provide insights into other properties that
  may need to be managed via an Azure Policy definition.

This article shows how to query Resource configuration changes through Resource Graph. To see this
information in the Azure portal, see [Azure Resource Graph Explorer](../first-query-portal.md), Azure Policy's
[Change history](../../policy/how-to/determine-non-compliance.md#change-history), or Azure Activity
Log [Change history](../../../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md#view-the-activity-log). For
details about changes to your applications from the infrastructure layer all the way to application
deployment, see
[Use Application Change Analysis (preview)](../../../azure-monitor/app/change-analysis.md) in Azure
Monitor.

> [!NOTE]
> Resource configuration changes is for Azure Resource Manager properties. For tracking changes inside
> a virtual machine, see Azure Automation's
> [Change tracking](../../../automation/change-tracking/overview.md) or Azure Policy's
> [Guest Configuration for VMs](../../policy/concepts/guest-configuration.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resource configuration changes is in Public Preview and only supports changes to resource types from the [Resources table](..//reference/supported-tables-resources.md#resources) in Resource Graph. This does not yet include changes to the resource container resources, such as Management groups, Subscriptions, and Resource groups.

## Find detected change events and view change details

When a resource is created, updated, or deleted, a new change resource (Microsoft.Resources/changes) is created to extend the modified resource and represent the changed properties.

Example change resource property bag:

```json
{
  "targetResourceId": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/myVM",
  "targetResourceType": "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines",
  "changeType": "Update",
  "changeAttributes": {
    "changesCount": 2,
    "correlationId": "88420d5d-8d0e-471f-9115-10d34750c617",
    "timestamp": "2021-12-07T09:25:41.756Z",
    "previousResourceSnapshotId": "ed90e35a-1661-42cc-a44c-e27f508005be",
    "newResourceSnapshotId": "6eac9d0f-63b4-4e7f-97a5-740c73757efb"
  },
  "changes": {
    "properties.provisioningState": {
      "newValue": "Succeeded",
      "previousValue": "Updating",
      "changeCategory": "System",
      "propertyChangeType": "Update"
    },
    "tags.key1": {
      "newValue": "NewTagValue",
      "previousValue": "null",
      "changeCategory": "User",
      "propertyChangeType": "Insert"
    }
  }
}
```

Each change resource has the following properties:

- **targetResourceId** - The resourceID of the resource on which the change occurred.
 - **targetResourceType** - The resource type of the resource on which the change occurred.
- **changeType** - Describes the type of change detected for the entire change record. Values are: _Create_, _Update_, and _Delete_. The
  **changes** property dictionary is only included when **changeType** is _Update_. For the _Delete_ case, the change resource will still be maintained as an extension of the deleted resource for seven days, even if the entire Resource group has been deleted. The change resource will not block deletions or impact any existing delete behavior.


- **changes** - Dictionary of the resource properties (with property name as the key) that were updated as part of the change:
  - **propertyChangeType** - Describes the type of change detected for the individual resource property.
    Values are: _Insert_, _Update_, _Remove_.
  - **previousValue** - The value of the resource property in the previous snapshot. Value is _null_ when **changeType** is _Insert_.
  - **newValue** - The value of the resource property in the new snapshot. Value is _null_ when **changeType** is _Remove_.
  - **changeCategory** - Describes if the property change was the result of a change in value (_User_) or a difference in referenced API versions (_System_). Values are: _System_ and _User_.

- **changeAttributes** - Array of metadata related to the change:
  - **changesCount** - The number of properties changed as part of this change record.
  - **correlationId** - Contains the ID for tracking related events. Each deployment has a correlation ID, and all actions in a single template will share the same correlation ID.
  - **timestamp** - The datetime of when the change was detected.
  - **previousResourceSnapshotId** - Contains the ID of the resource snapshot that was used as the previous state of the resource.
  - **newResourceSnapshotId** - Contains the ID of the resource snapshot that was used as the new state of the resource.

## Resource Graph Query samples

With Resource Graph, you can query the **ResourceChanges** table to filter or sort by any of the change resource properties:

### All changes in the past one day
```kusto
ResourceChanges
| extend changeTime = todatetime(properties.changeAttributes.timestamp), targetResourceId = tostring(properties.targetResourceId),
changeType = tostring(properties.changeType), correlationId = properties.changeAttributes.correlationId, 
changedProperties = properties.changes, changeCount = properties.changeAttributes.changesCount
| where changeTime > ago(1d)
| order by changeTime desc
| project changeTime, targetResourceId, changeType, correlationId, changeCount, changedProperties
```

### Resources deleted in a specific resource group
```kusto
ResourceChanges
| where resourceGroup == "myResourceGroup"
| extend changeTime = todatetime(properties.changeAttributes.timestamp), targetResourceId = tostring(properties.targetResourceId),
changeType = tostring(properties.changeType), correlationId = properties.changeAttributes.correlationId
| where changeType == "Delete"
| order by changeTime desc
| project changeTime, resourceGroup, targetResourceId, changeType, correlationId
```

### Changes to a specific property value
```kusto
ResourceChanges
| extend provisioningStateChange = properties.changes["properties.provisioningState"], changeTime = todatetime(properties.changeAttributes.timestamp), targetResourceId = tostring(properties.targetResourceId), changeType = tostring(properties.changeType)
| where isnotempty(provisioningStateChange)and provisioningStateChange.newValue == "Succeeded"
| order by changeTime desc
| project changeTime, targetResourceId, changeType, provisioningStateChange.previousValue, provisioningStateChange.newValue
```

### Query the latest resource configuration for resources created in the last seven days
```kusto
ResourceChanges
| extend targetResourceId = tostring(properties.targetResourceId), changeType = tostring(properties.changeType), changeTime = todatetime(properties.changeAttributes.timestamp)
| where changeTime > ago(7d) and changeType == "Create"
| project  targetResourceId, changeType, changeTime
| join ( Resources | extend targetResourceId=id) on targetResourceId
| order by changeTime desc
| project changeTime, changeType, id, resourceGroup, type, properties
```
