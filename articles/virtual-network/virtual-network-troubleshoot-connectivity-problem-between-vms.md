# Troubleshooting connectivity problems between Azure VMs

You might experience connectivity problems between Azure VMs. This article provides troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this problem. 

[!INCLUDE [support-disclaimer](../../includes/support-disclaimer.md)]

## Symptom

An Azure VM cannot connect to another Azure VM.

## Troubleshooting guidance 

1. [Check if NIC is misconfigured](#step-1-check-if-nic-is-misconfigured)
2. [Check if network traffic is blocked by NSG or UDR](#step-2-check-if-network-traffic-is-blocked-by-nsg-or-udr)
3. [Check if network traffic is blocked by VM firewall](#step-3-check-if-network-traffic-is-blocked-by-vm-firewall)
4. [Check whether VM app or service is listening on the port](#step-4-check-whether-vm-app-or-service-is-listening-on-the-port)
5. [Check whether the problem is caused by SNAT](#step-5-check-whether-the-problem-is-caused-by-snat)
6. [Check whether traffic is blocked by ACLs for the classic VM](#step-6-check-whether-traffic-is-blocked-by-acls-for-the-classic-vm)
7. [Check whether the endpoint is created for the classic VM](#step-7-check-whether-the-endpoint-is-created-for-the-classic-vm)
8. [Unable to connect to a VM network share](#step-8-unable-to-connect-to-a-vm-network-share)
9. [Inter-Vnet connectivity](#step-9-inter-vnet-connectivity)

## Troubleshooting steps

Follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem. Check whether the problem is resolved after each step. 

### Step 1: Check if NIC is misconfigured

Follow [How to reset network interface for Azure Windows VM](../virtual-machines/windows/reset-network-interface.md). 

If the problem occurs after you modify the network interface (NIC), follow these steps:

**Mulit-NIC VMs**

1. Add a NIC.
2. Fix the problems in the bad NIC or remove bad NIC.  Then readd the NIC.

For more information, see [Add network interfaces to or remove from virtual machines](virtual-network-network-interface-vm.md).

**Single-NIC VM** 

- [Redeploy Windows VM](../virtual-machines/windows/redeploy-to-new-node.md)
- [Redeploy Linux VM](../virtual-machines/linux/redeploy-to-new-node.md)

### Step 2: Check if network traffic is blocked by NSG or UDR

Utilize [Network Watcher IP Flow Verify](../network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview.md) and [NSG Flow Logging](../network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview.md) to identify if there is a Network Security Group or User-Defined Route that is interfering with traffic flow.

### Step 3: Check if network traffic is blocked by VM firewall

Disable the firewall, and then test the result. If the problem is resolved, validate the settings in the firewall and re-enable.

### Step 4: Check whether VM app or service is listening on the port

You can use one of the following methods to check whether VM Application or Service is listening on the port

- Run the following commands to check whether the server is listening on that port.

**Windows VM**

    netstat â€“ano

**Linux VM**

    netstat -l

- Run the **Telnet** command on the VM to itself to test the port. If the test fails, application or service is not configured to listen on the port.

### Step 5: Check whether the problem is caused by SNAT

In some scenarios, the VM is placed behind a Load balance solution that has a dependency on resources outside of Azure. In these scenarios, if you experience intermittent connection problems, the problem may be caused by [SNAT port exhaustion](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md). To resolve the issue, create a VIP (or ILPIP for classic) for each VM that is behind the Load balancer and secure with NSG or ACL. 

### Step 6: Check whether traffic is blocked by ACLs for the classic VM

An ACL provides the ability to selectively permit or deny traffic for a virtual machine endpoint. For more information, see [Manage the ACL on an endpoint](../virtual-machines/windows/classic/setup-endpoints.md#manage-the-acl-on-an-endpoint).

### Step 7: Check whether the endpoint is created for the classic VM

All VMs that you create in Azure using the classic deployment model can automatically communicate over a private network channel with other virtual machines in the same cloud service or virtual network. However, computers on other virtual networks require endpoints to direct the inbound network traffic to a virtual machine. For more information, see [How to set up endpoints](../virtual-machines/windows/classic/setup-endpoints.md).

### Step 8: Unable to connect to a VM network share

If you are unable to connect to a VM network share, the problem can be caused by unavailable NICs in the VM. To delete the unavailable NICs, see [How to delete the unavailable NICs](../virtual-machines/windows/reset-network-interface.md#delete-the-unavailable-nics)

### Step 9: Inter-Vnet connectivity

Utilize [Network Watcher IP Flow Verify](../network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview.md) and [NSG Flow Logging](../network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview.md) to identify if there is a Network Security Group or User-Defined Route that is interfering with traffic flow. You can also validate your Inter-Vnet configuration [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4032151/configuring-and-validating-vnet-or-vpn-connections).
