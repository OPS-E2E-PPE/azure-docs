### Recommendation to configure dead-letter queues for Lambda functions to be deprecated

**Estimated date for change: November 2022**

The recommendation [`Lambda functions should have a dead-letter queue configured`](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/AwsRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/dcf10b98-798f-4734-9afd-800916bf1e65/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) is set to be deprecated.

| Recommendation | Description | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| Lambda functions should have a dead-letter queue configured | This control checks whether a Lambda function is configured with a dead-letter queue. The control fails if the Lambda function isn't configured with a dead-letter queue. As an alternative to an on-failure destination, you can configure your function with a dead-letter queue to save discarded events for further processing. A dead-letter queue acts the same as an on-failure destination. It's used when an event fails all processing attempts or expires without being processed. A dead-letter queue allows you to look back at errors or failed requests to your Lambda function to debug or identify unusual behavior. From a security perspective, it's important to understand why your function failed and to ensure that your function doesn't drop data or compromise data security as a result. For example, if your function can't communicate to an underlying resource, that could be a symptom of a denial of service (DoS) attack elsewhere in the network. | Medium |

### Recommendation to enable diagnostic logs for Virtual Machine Scale Sets to be deprecated

**Estimated date for change: December 2022**

The recommendation [`Diagnostic logs in Virtual Machine Scale Sets should be enabled`](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/961eb649-3ea9-f8c2-6595-88e9a3aeedeb/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) is set to be deprecated. 

The related [policy definition](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7c1b1214-f927-48bf-8882-84f0af6588b1) will also be deprecated from any standards displayed in the regulatory compliance dashboard. 

| Recommendation | Description | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| Diagnostic logs in Virtual Machine Scale Sets should be enabled | Enable logs and retain them for up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised. | Low |

### The policy Vulnerability Assessment settings for SQL server should contain an email address to receive scan reports is set to be deprecated 

**Estimated date for change: December 2022**

The policy [`Vulnerability Assessment settings for SQL server should contain an email address to receive scan reports`](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F057d6cfe-9c4f-4a6d-bc60-14420ea1f1a9) is set to be deprecated. 

The Defender for SQL vulnerability assessment email report will still be available and existing email configurations won't change after the policy is deprecated.
