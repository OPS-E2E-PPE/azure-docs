### Deprecation and improvement of selected alerts for Windows and Linux Servers

**Estimated date for change: April 2023**

The security alert quality improvement process for Defender for Servers includes the deprecation of some alerts for both Windows and Linux servers. The deprecated alerts will now be sourced from and covered by Defender for Endpoint threat alerts.  

If you already have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled, no further action is required. You may experience a decrease in your alerts volume in April 2023.

If you don't have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled in Defender for Servers, you'll need to enable the Defender for Endpoint integration to maintain and improve your alert coverage. 

All Defender for Servers customers, have full access to the Defender for Endpointâ€™s integration as a part of the [Defender for Servers plan](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).  

You can learn more about [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding options](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#enable-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-integration).

You can also view the [full list of alerts](alerts-reference.md#defender-for-servers-alerts-to-be-deprecated) that are set to be deprecated.

### Deprecation of legacy compliance standards across cloud environments

**Estimated date for change: April 2023**

We're announcing the full deprecation of support of [`PCI DSS`](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss) standard/initiative in Azure China 21Vianet.

Legacy PCI DSS v3.2.1 and legacy SOC TSP are set to be fully deprecated and replaced by [SOC 2 Type 2](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-soc-2) initiative and [PCI DSS v4](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss) initiative.
Learn how to [Customize the set of standards in your regulatory compliance dashboard](update-regulatory-compliance-packages.md).

#### Deprecation of identity recommendations V1

The following security recommendations will be deprecated as part of this change:

| Recommendation | Assessment Key |
|--|--|
| MFA should be enabled on accounts with owner permissions on subscriptions | 94290b00-4d0c-d7b4-7cea-064a9554e681 |
| MFA should be enabled on accounts with write permissions on subscriptions | 57e98606-6b1e-6193-0e3d-fe621387c16b |
| MFA should be enabled on accounts with read permissions on subscriptions | 151e82c5-5341-a74b-1eb0-bc38d2c84bb5 |
| External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from subscriptions | c3b6ae71-f1f0-31b4-e6c1-d5951285d03d |
| External accounts with write permissions should be removed from subscriptions | 04e7147b-0deb-9796-2e5c-0336343ceb3d |
| External accounts with read permissions should be removed from subscriptions | a8c6a4ad-d51e-88fe-2979-d3ee3c864f8b |
| Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from subscriptions | e52064aa-6853-e252-a11e-dffc675689c2 |
| Deprecated accounts should be removed from subscriptions | 00c6d40b-e990-6acf-d4f3-471e747a27c4 |

We recommend updating custom scripts, workflows, and governance rules to correspond with the V2 recommendations.

We've improved the coverage of the V2 identity recommendations by scanning all Azure resources (rather than just subscriptions) which allows security administrators to view role assignments per account. These changes may result in changes to your Secure Score throughout the GA process.

### DevOps Resource Deduplication for Defender for DevOps

**Estimated date for change: June 2023**

To improve the Defender for DevOps user experience and enable further integration with Defender for Cloud's rich set of capabilities, Defender for DevOps will no longer support duplicate instances of a DevOps organization to be onboarded to an Azure tenant. 

If you don't have an instance of a DevOps organization onboarded more than once to your organization, no further action is required. If you do have more than one instance of a DevOps organization onboarded to your tenant, the subscription owner will be notified and will need to delete the DevOps Connector(s) they don't want to keep by navigating to Defender for Cloud Environment Settings. 

Customers will have until June 30, 2023 to resolve this issue. After this date, only the most recent DevOps Connector created where an instance of the DevOps organization exists, will remain onboarded to Defender for DevOps.
