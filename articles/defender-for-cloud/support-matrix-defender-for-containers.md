### Kubernetes distributions and configurations for Azure - Runtime threat protection

| Aspect | Details |
|--|--|
| Kubernetes distributions and configurations | **Supported**<br> • [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks/intro-kubernetes.md) with [Kubernetes RBAC](../aks/concepts-identity.md#kubernetes-rbac) <br><br> **Supported via Arc enabled Kubernetes** <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup><br> • [Azure Kubernetes Service hybrid](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-hybrid-options-overview)<br> • [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)<br> • [AKS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine)<br> • [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/openshift/)|

<sup><a name="footnote1"></a>1</sup> Any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters should be supported, but only the specified clusters have been tested on Azure.

<sup><a name="footnote2"></a>2</sup> To get [Microsoft Defender for Containers](../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction.md) protection for your environments, you need to onboard [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](../azure-arc/kubernetes/overview.md) and enable Defender for Containers as an Arc extension.

> [!NOTE]
> For additional requirements for Kubernetes workload protection, see [existing limitations](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#limitations).

### Private link restrictions

Defender for Containers relies on the [Defender agent](defender-for-cloud-glossary.md#defender-agent) for several features. The Defender agent doesn't support  the ability to ingest data through Private Link. You can disable public access for ingestion, so that only machines that are configured to send traffic through Azure Monitor Private Link can send data to that workstation. You can configure a private link by navigating to **`your workspace`** > **Network Isolation** and setting the Virtual networks access configurations to **No**.

:::image type="content" source="media/supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-cloud-containers/network-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to go to turn off data ingestion.":::

Allowing data ingestion to occur only through Private Link Scope on your workspace Network Isolation settings, can result in communication failures and partial converge of the Defender for Containers feature set.

- Mariner 1.0
- Mariner 2.0
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

Ensure your Kubernetes node is running on one of the verified supported operating systems. Clusters with different host operating systems, only get partial coverage.

#### Defender agent limitations

The Defender agent is currently not supported on ARM64 nodes.

#### Network restrictions

##### Private link

Defender for Containers relies on the Defender agent for several features. The Defender agent doesn't support  the ability to ingest data through Private Link. You can disable public access for ingestion, so that only machines that are configured to send traffic through Azure Monitor Private Link can send data to that workstation.
