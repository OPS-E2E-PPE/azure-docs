# Alerts and incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integration with Microsoft 365 Defender allows security teams to access Defender for Cloud alerts and incidents within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. This integration provides richer context to investigations that span cloud resources, devices, and identities. 

The partnership with Microsoft 365 Defender allows security teams to get the complete picture of an attack, including suspicious and malicious events that happen in their cloud environment. This is achieved through immediate correlations of alerts and incidents. 

Microsoft 365 Defender offers a comprehensive solution that combines protection, detection, investigation, and response capabilities to protect against attacks on device, email, collaboration, identity, and cloud apps. Our detection and investigation capabilities are now extended to cloud entities, offering security operations teams a single pane of glass to significantly improve their operational efficiency. 

Incidents and alerts are now part of [Microsoft 365 Defender's public API](/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-overview?view=o365-worldwide). This integration allows exporting of security alerts data to any system using a single API. As Microsoft Defender for Cloud, we're committed to providing our users with the best possible security solutions, and this integration is a significant step towards achieving that goal.
