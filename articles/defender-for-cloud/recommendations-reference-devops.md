# Security recommendations for DevOps resources

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud if you connect an [Azure DevOps](quickstart-onboard-devops.md), [GitHub](quickstart-onboard-github.md), or [GitLab](quickstart-onboard-gitlab.md) environment by using the **Environment settings** page. The recommendations that appear in your environment are based on the resources that you're protecting and on your customized configuration.

To learn about actions that you can take in response to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).

Learn more about [DevOps security](defender-for-devops-introduction.md) benefits and features.

DevOps recommendations don't affect your [secure score](secure-score-security-controls.md). To decide which recommendations to resolve first, look at the severity of each recommendation and its potential impact on your secure score.
