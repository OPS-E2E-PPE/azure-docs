# Agentless Container Posture (Preview)

You can identify security risks that exist in containers and Kubernetes realms with the agentless discovery and visibility capability across SDLC and runtime.

You can maximize the coverage of your container posture issues and extend your protection beyond the reach of agent-based assessments to provide a holistic approach to your posture improvement. This includes, for example, container vulnerability assessment insights as part of [Cloud Security Explorer](how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer.md) and Kubernetes [Attack Path](attack-path-reference.md#azure-containers) analysis.

Learn more about [Cloud Security Posture Management](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Agentless Container Posture preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available" and are excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. Agentless Container Posture previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use.

## Capabilities

Agentless Container Posture provides the following capabilities:

- Using Kubernetes Attack Path analysis to visualize risks and threats to Kubernetes environments.
- Using Cloud Security Explorer for risk hunting by querying various risk scenarios.
- Viewing security insights, such as internet exposure, and other pre-defined security scenarios. For more information, search for `Kubernetes` in the [list of Insights](attack-path-reference.md#insights).
- Agentless discovery and visibility within Kubernetes components.
- Agentless container registry vulnerability assessment, using the image scanning results of your Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Cloud Security Explorer.

    [Vulnerability assessment](defender-for-containers-vulnerability-assessment-azure.md) for Containers in Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) gives you frictionless, wide, and instant visibility on actionable posture issues without the need for installed agents, network connectivity requirements, or container performance impact.

All of these capabilities are available as part of the [Defender Cloud Security Posture Management](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) plan.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your Defender for CSPM plan is enabled. Defender for Containers is not required.

This feature uses trusted access. Learn more about [AKS trusted access prerequisites](/azure/aks/trusted-access-feature#prerequisites).

## Enable extension for Agentless Container Posture for CSPM

Defender CSPM includes [two extensions](#what-are-the-extensions-for-agentless-container-posture-management) that allow for agentless visibility into Kubernetes and containers registries across your organization's SDLC and runtime.

**To enable the extensions for Agentless Containers Posture in your container environments:**

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Defender for Cloud's **Environment Settings** page.

1. Select the subscription that's onboarded to the Defender CSPM plan, then select **Settings**.

1. Ensure the **Agentless discovery for Kubernetes** and **Container registries vulnerability assessments** extensions are toggled to **On**.

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Select **Save**.

A notification message pops up in the top right corner that will verify that the settings were saved successfully.

## What are the extensions for Agentless Container Posture management?

There are two extensions that provide agentless CSPM functionality:

- **Container registries vulnerability assessments**: Provides containers registries vulnerability assessments. Recommendations are available based on the vulnerability assessment timeline. Learn more about [image scanning](defender-for-containers-vulnerability-assessment-azure.md).

- **Agentless discovery for Kubernetes**: Provides API-based discovery of information about Kubernetes cluster architecture, workload objects, and setup.

The discovery process is based on snapshots taken at intervals:

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-agentless-containers/diagram-permissions-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram of the permissions architecture." lightbox="media/concept-agentless-containers/diagram-permissions-architecture.png":::

When you enable the **Agentless discovery for Kubernetes** extension, the following process occurs:

- **Create**: MDC (Microsoft Defender for Cloud) creates an identity in customer environments called CloudPosture/securityOperator/DefenderCSPMSecurityOperator.

- **Assign**: MDC assigns a built-in role called **Kubernetes Agentless Operator** to that identity on subscription scope.

    The role contains the following permissions:
    - AKS read (Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read)
    - AKS Trusted Access with the following permissions:
        - Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/trustedAccessRoleBindings/write
        - Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/trustedAccessRoleBindings/read
        - Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/trustedAccessRoleBindings/delete

        Learn more about [AKS Trusted Access](/azure/aks/trusted-access-feature).

- **Discover**: Using the system assigned identity, MDC performs a discovery of the AKS clusters in your environment using API calls to the API server of AKS.

- **Bind**: Upon discovery of an AKS cluster, MDC performs an AKS bind operation between the created identity and the Kubernetes role “Microsoft.Security/pricings/microsoft-defender-operator”. The role is visible via API and gives MDC data plane read permission inside the cluster.

## FAQs

### What's the refresh interval?

Agentless information in Defender CSPM is updated through a snapshot mechanism. It can take up to **24 hours** to see results in Cloud Security Explorer and Attack Path.

### How can I onboard multiple subscriptions at once?

To onboard multiple subscriptions at once, you can use this [script](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Powershell%20scripts/Agentless%20Container%20Posture).

### Why don't I see results from my clusters?

If you don't see results from your clusters, check the following:

- Do you have [stopped clusters](#what-do-i-do-if-i-have-stopped-clusters)?
- Are your [resource groups, subscriptions, or clusters locked](#what-do-i-do-if-i-have-locked-resource-groups-subscriptions-or-clusters)?

### What do I do if I have stopped clusters?

We suggest that you rerun the cluster to solve this issue.

### What do I do if I have locked resource groups, subscriptions, or clusters?

We suggest that you unlock the locked resource group / subscription / cluster, make the relevant requests manually, and then re-lock the resource group / subscription / cluster by doing the following:

1. Enable the feature flag manually via CLI:

    ``` CLI
    “az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "TrustedAccessPreview”
    ```
    
    Learn more about [Trusted Access](/azure/aks/trusted-access-feature).
    
1. Perform the bind operation in the CLI:

    ``` CLI
    az account set -s <SubscriptionId>
    az extension add --name aks-preview
    az aks trustedaccess rolebinding create --resource-group <cluster resource group> --cluster-name <cluster name> --name defender-cloudposture --source-resource-id /subscriptions/<SubscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.Security/pricings/CloudPosture/securityOperators/DefenderCSPMSecurityOperator --roles  "Microsoft.Security/pricings/microsoft-defender-operator"
    ```
For locked clusters, you can also do one of the following:

- Remove the lock.
- Perform the bind operation manually by doing an API request.
