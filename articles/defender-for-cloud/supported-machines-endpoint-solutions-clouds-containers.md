## Additional information

### Registries and images

|--|--|
| Registries and images | **Supported**<br> • [ACR registries protected with Azure Private Link](../container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md) (Private registries requires access to Trusted Services) <br> • Windows images (Preview). This is free while it's in preview, and will incur charges (based on the Defender for Containers plan) when it becomes generally available.<br><br>**Unsupported**<br> • Super-minimalist images such as [Docker scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/) images<br> • "Distroless" images that only contain an application and its runtime dependencies without a package manager, shell, or OS<br> • Images with [Open Container Initiative (OCI) Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md) |


### Kubernetes distributions and configurations

| Aspect | Details |
|--|--|
| Kubernetes distributions and configurations | **Supported**<br> • Any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters<br>• [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks/intro-kubernetes.md)<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup><br> • [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)<br> • [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) <br><br> **Supported via Arc enabled Kubernetes** <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup><br>• [Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/aks-hci/overview)<br> • [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)<br> • [AKS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine)<br> • [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/openshift/)<br> • [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/kubernetes/) (version 4.6 or newer)<br> • [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid)<br> • [Rancher Kubernetes Engine](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/)<br><br>**Unsupported**<br> • Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Clusters without [Kubernetes RBAC](../aks/concepts-identity.md#kubernetes-rbac)  <br>  |

<sup><a name="footnote1"></a>1</sup>The AKS Defender profile doesn't support AKS clusters that don't have RBAC role enabled.<br>
<sup><a name="footnote2"></a>2</sup>Any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters should be supported, but only the specified clusters have been tested.<br>
<sup><a name="footnote3"></a>3</sup>To get [Microsoft Defender for Containers](../azure-arc/kubernetes/overview.md) protection for you should onboard to [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/TechnicalContent/_workitems/recentlyupdated/) and enable Defender for Containers as an Arc extension.
