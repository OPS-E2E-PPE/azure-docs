## DevOps recommendations

| Recommendation | Description | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| (Preview) [Azure DevOps repositories should have GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps (GHAzDO) enabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsWithRulesBlade/assessmentKey/c7a934bf-7be6-407a-84d9-4f20e6e49592/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | Defender for DevOps uses a central console to empower security teams with the ability to protect applications and resources from code to cloud across Azure DevOps. With enablement of GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps (GHAzDO) repositories includes GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps you get findings about secrets, dependencies and code vulnerabilities in your Azure DevOps repositories surfaced in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. | High |

To improve the security posture of the repositories, it is highly recommended to remediate these vulnerabilities. | Medium |
| (Preview) [Azure DevOps repositories should have Infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsWithRulesBlade/assessmentKey/6588c4d4-fbbb-4fb8-be45-7c2de7dc1b3b/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | Infrastructure as code security configuration issues have been found in repositories. The issues shown below have been detected in template files. To improve the security posture of the related cloud resources, it is highly recommended to remediate these issues. | Medium |

This should be remediated immediately to prevent a security breach. Secrets found in repositories can be leaked or discovered by adversaries, leading to compromise of an application or service. Note: The Microsoft Security DevOps credential scanning tool only scans builds on which it has been configured to run. Therefore, results may not reflect the complete status of secrets in your repositories. | High |

Code scanning can be used to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in your code. Code scanning can also prevent developers from introducing new problems. Scans can be scheduled for specific days and times, or scans can be triggered when a specific event occurs in the repository, such as a push. If code scanning finds a potential vulnerability or error in code, GitHub displays an alert in the repository. A vulnerability is a problem in a project's code that could be exploited to damage the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project. | Medium |
| (Preview) [GitHub repositories should have Dependabot scanning enabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsWithRulesBlade/assessmentKey/c64e7cfb-6d64-4227-8c23-b4fa5c72957b/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | GitHub sends Dependabot alerts when it detects vulnerabilities in code dependencies that affect repositories. A vulnerability is a problem in a project's code that could be exploited to damage the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project or other projects that use its code. Vulnerabilities vary in type, severity, and method of attack. When code depends on a package that has a security vulnerability, this vulnerable dependency can cause a range of problems. | Medium |
| (Preview) [GitHub repositories should have secret scanning enabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsWithRulesBlade/assessmentKey/b6ad173c-0cc6-4d44-b954-8217c8837a8e/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) |	GitHub scans repositories for known types of secrets, to prevent fraudulent use of secrets that were accidentally committed to repositories. Secret scanning will scan the entire Git history on all branches present in the GitHub repository for any secrets. Examples of secrets are tokens and private keys that a service provider can issue for authentication. If a secret is checked into a repository, anyone who has read access to the repository can use the secret to access the external service with those privileges. Secrets should be stored in a dedicated, secure location outside the repository for the project. | High |
