# Protect your servers with Defender for Servers

Defender for Servers in Microsoft Defender for Cloud brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your Windows and Linux machines that run in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and on-premises environments. This plan includes the integrated license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, security baselines and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more.

Microsoft Defender for Servers includes an automatic, native integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Learn more, [Protect your endpoints with Defender for Cloud's integrated EDR solution: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md). With this integration enabled, you have access to the vulnerability findings from **Microsoft threat and vulnerability management**.

Defender for Servers offers two plan options with different levels of protection and their own cost. You can learn more about Defender for Cloud's pricing on [the pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

### Configure monitoring coverage

There are three components that can be enabled and configured to provide extra protections to your environments in the Defender for Servers plans.

| Component | Description | Learn more |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| [Log Analytics agent/Azure Monitor agent](plan-defender-for-servers-agents.md) | Collects security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and stores the data in your Log Analytics workspace for analysis. | [Learn more](../azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent.md) about the Log Analytics agent. |
| Vulnerability assessment for machines | Enables vulnerability assessment on your Azure and hybrid machines. | [Learn more](monitoring-components.md) about how Defender for Cloud collects data. |
| [Agentless scanning for machines](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) | Scans your machines for installed software and vulnerabilities without relying on agents or impacting machine performance. | [Learn more](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) about agentless scanning for machines. |

Toggle the corresponding switch to **On**, to enable any of these options.

### Configure Log Analytics agent/Azure Monitor agent

After enabling the Log Analytics agent/Azure Monitor agent, you'll be presented with the option to select either the Log Analytics agent or the Azure Monitor agent and which workspace should be utilized.

**To configure the Log Analytics agent/Azure Monitor agent**:

1. Select **Edit configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/edit-configuration-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows you where on the screen you need to select edit configuration, to edit the log analytics agent/azure monitor agent." lightbox="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/edit-configuration-log.png":::

1. In the Auto provisioning configuration window, select one of the following two agent types:

    - **Log Analytic Agent (Default)** - Collects security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and stores the data in your Log Analytics workspace for analysis.

    - **Azure Monitor Agent (Preview)** - Collects security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and stores the data in your Log Analytics workspace for analysis.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/auto-provisioning-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the auto provisioning configuration screen with the available options to select." lightbox="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/auto-provisioning-screen.png":::

1. Select either a **Default workspace(s)** or a **Custom workspace** depending on your need.

1. Select **Apply**.

### Configure vulnerability assessment for machines

Vulnerability assessment for machines allows you to select between two vulnerability assessment solutions:

- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrated Qualys scanner

**To select either of the vulnerability assessment solutions**:

1. Select **Edit configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/vulnerability-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows you where to select edit for vulnerabilities assessment for machines." lightbox="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/vulnerability-edit.png":::

1. In the Extension deployment configuration window, select either of the solutions depending on your need.

1. Select **Apply**.

### Configure agentless scanning for machines

Defender for Cloud has the ability to scan your Azure machines for installed software and vulnerabilities without requiring you to install agents, have network connectivity or affect your machine's performance.

**To configure agentless scanning for machines**:

1. Select **Edit configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/agentless-scanning-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where you need to select to edit the configuration of the agentless scanner." lightbox="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/agentless-scanning-edit.png":::

1. Enter a tag name and tag value for any machines to be excluded from scans.

1. Select **Apply**.

## Enable the plan at the resource level

While our recommendation is to enable Defender for Servers on the entire Azure subscription, to protect all existing and future resources in it, there are some cases where more flexibility is required for excluding specific resources or to manage security configurations at a lower hierarchy level than subscription. Resource level enablement is available for **Azure machines** and on-premises with **Azure Arc** as part of Defender for Servers plans:

- **Defender for Servers Plan 1**: you can enable / disable the plan at the resource level.
- **Defender for Servers Plan 2**: you can only disable the plan at the resource level. For example, it’s possible to enable the plan at the subscription level and disable specific resources, however it’s not possible to enable the plan only for specific resources.

### Supported resource types

Supported resource types include:

- Azure VMs
- On-premises with Azure Arc
- VMSS Flex

### Enablement via REST API

The ability to enable or disable Defender for Servers at the resource level is available exclusively via REST API. Learn how to [interact with the API](/rest/api/defenderforcloud/pricings) to manage your Defender for Servers at the resource or subscription level.

### The effect on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployment

 Automatic deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will be supported and aligned with the VM pricing state.

- Including VMs in Servers Plan 1 will trigger automatic deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (if not already deployed).
- Excluding VMs from Servers Plan 1/Plan 2 will also exclude from deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (if not already deployed).

> [!NOTE]
> In general, Defender for Servers does not uninstall Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployments after Servers Plan 1/Plan 2 is deactivated (at the subscription or resource level). To manually remove Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on your machine, follow the steps to [offboard devices](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/offboard-machines).

Since Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployment for eligible machines is a near real-time service, certain configurations require attention to avoid unintentional agent deployments. For example:

- If you plan to roll out and enable Servers Plan 1/Plan 2 at the subscription level and exclude individual existing VMs, make sure you exclude the VMs before (or at the same time) you enable the plan at the subscription level.
- When you plan to exclude new VMs created under a subscription already enabled for P1/P2, make sure you exclude them during or shortly after creation time, to avoid unintentional deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

### Enablement at scale

Use the following base script file to customize it for your specific needs.

1. [Download this file](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Powershell%20scripts/Defender%20for%20Servers%20on%20resource%20level), save it as a PowerShell file, and run it.
1. Select whether to set pricing by **tag** or by **resource group**.
1. Follow the onscreen instructions.

### Monitoring coverage status

To monitor your coverage status, you can use the inventory. In the main menu, select **Inventory** and then check the **plan status** in the “Defender for cloud” column:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/select-inventory.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows you where to select Inventory from the main menu." lightbox="media/tutorial-enable-servers-plan/select-inventory.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Servers settings on each resource are inherited by the subscription-level settings by default. Once you change settings at the resource level, the resource will no longer inherit settings from its parent subscription unless you delete the settings you configured.
