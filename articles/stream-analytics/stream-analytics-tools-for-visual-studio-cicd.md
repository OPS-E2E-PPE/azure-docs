# Use Stream Analytics Visual Studio tools to set up the continuous integration and deployment process
In this tutorial, you learn how to use the Stream Analytics Visual Studio tools to set up the continuous integration and deployment process.

The latest version (2.3.0000.0 or above) of [Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-tools-for-visual-studio) adds the support for **MSBuild**. 

There is also a newly released NuGet package [Microsoft.Azure.Stream Analytics.CICD](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.StreamAnalytics.CICD/). It provides the MSBuild, local run, and deployment tools that support the continuous integration and deployment process of Stream Analytics Visual Studio projects. 
> [!NOTE] 
The NuGet package can only be used with the 2.3.0000.0 or above version of Stream Analytics Tools for Visual Studio. If you have projects created in previous versions of Visual Studio tools, just open it with the 2.3.0000.0 or above version and save. Then you have the new capabilities enabled.

## MSBuild
Like the standard Visual Studio MSBuild experience, to build a project you can either right-click on the project then choose **Build**, 
or use **MSBuild** in the NuGet package from command line.
```
./build/msbuild /t:build [Your Project Full Path] /p:CompilerTaskAssemblyFile=Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StreamAnalytics.Common.CompileService.dll  /p:ASATargetsFilePath="[NuGet Package Local Path]\build\StreamAnalytics.targets"

```

When a Stream Analytics Visual Studio project builds successfully, it generates the following two Azure Resource Manager template files under **bin/[Debug/Retail]/Deploy** folder: 

Azure Resource Manager template file.
*       [ProjectName].JobTemplate.json 

Azure Resource Manager parameters file.
*       [ProjectName].JobTemplate.parameters.json   

The default parameters in the parameters.json file are from the settings in your Visual Studio project. If you want to deploy to other environment, just replace the parameters accordingly. 
> [!NOTE] 
For all the credentials, the default values are all set to null. They are **REQUIRED** to set before you deploy it to the cloud.
```json
"Input_EntryStream_sharedAccessPolicyKey": {
      "value": null
    },
```

## Command-line tool

### Build the project
In the NuGet package, there is a command-line tool called **SA.exe**. It supports project build, local testing on an arbitrary machine, which you can use in your continuous integration and continuous delivery process. 

The deployment files are placed under the current directory by default. You can specify the output path by -OutputPath parameter.

```
./tools/SA.exe build -Project [Your Project Full Path] [-OutputPath <outputPath>] 
```

### Test the script locally

If your project has specified local input files in Visual Studio, you can run automated script test by using the *localrun* command. The output result is placed 
under current directory.
 
```
localrun -Project [ProjectFullPath]
```

### Generate job definition file to use with Stream Analytics Power Shell.

The *arm* command takes the job template and job template parameter files generated through build as input. Then combine them into a job definition JSON file that can be used 
with Stream Analytics PowerShell API.

```
arm -JobTemplate <templateFilePath> -JobParameterFile <jobParameterFilePath> [-OutputFile <asaArmFilePath>]
```

```
Example
./tools/SA.exe arm -JobTemplate "ProjectA.JobTemplate.json" -JobParameterFile "ProjectA.JobTemplate.parameters.json" -OutputFile "JobDefinition.json" 
```
