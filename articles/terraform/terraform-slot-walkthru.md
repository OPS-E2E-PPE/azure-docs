# Using Terraform to provision infrastructure with Azure deployment slots

[Azure deployment slots](/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing) allow you to swap between different versions of your app - such as production and staging - to minimize the impact of broken deployments. This article illustrates an example use of deployment slots by walking you through the deployment of two apps via GitHub and Azure. One app is hosted in a "production slot", while the second app is hosted in a "staging" slot. (The names "production" and "staging" are arbitrary and can be anything you want that represents your scenario.) Once your deployment slots have been configured, you can then use Terraform to swap between the two slots as needed.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription** - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

- **GitHub account** - A [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account is needed to fork and use the test GitHub repo.

## Create and apply the Terraform plan

1. Browse to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com)

1. Open [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview), and - if not done previously - select **Bash** as your environment.

    ![Cloud Shell prompt](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/azure-portal-cloud-shell-button-min.png)

1. Change directories to the `clouddrive` directory.

    ```bash
    cd clouddrive
    ```

1. Create a directory named `deploy`.

    ```bash
    mkdir deploy
    ```

1. Create a directory named `swap`.

    ```bash
    mkdir swap
    ```

1. Verify that both directories have been successfully created using the `ls` bash command.

    ![Cloud shell after creating directories](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/cloud-shell-after-creating-dirs.png)

1. Change directories to the `deploy` directory.

    ```bash
    cd deploy
    ```

1. Using the [vi editor](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-tutorial/ch-editor.html), create a file named `deploy.tf`, which will contain the [Terraform configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html).

    ```bash
    vi deploy.tf
    ```

1. Enter insert mode by pressing the letter `i` key.

1. Paste the following code into the editor:

    ```JSON
    # Configure the Azure Provider
    provider "azurerm" { }

    resource "azurerm_resource_group" "slotDemo" {
        name = "slotDemoResourceGroup"
        location = "westus2"
    }

    resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "slotDemo" {
        name                = "slotAppServicePlan"
        location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.location}"
        resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.name}"
        sku {
            tier = "Standard"
            size = "S1"
        }
    }

    resource "azurerm_app_service" "slotDemo" {
        name                = "slotAppService"
        location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.location}"
        resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.name}"
        app_service_plan_id = "${azurerm_app_service_plan.slotDemo.id}"
    }

    resource "azurerm_app_service_slot" "slotDemo" {
        name                = "slotAppServiceSlotOne"
        location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.location}"
        resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.name}"
        app_service_plan_id = "${azurerm_app_service_plan.slotDemo.id}"
        app_service_name    = "${azurerm_app_service.slotDemo.name}"
    }
    ```

1. Press the **&lt;Esc>** key to exit insert mode.

1. Save the file and exit the vi editor by entering the following command, followed by pressing **&lt;Enter>**:

    ```bash
    :wq
    ```

1. Once the file has been created, you can verify its contents.

    ```bash
    cat deploy.tf
    ```

1. Initialize Terraform.

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

1. Create the Terraform plan.

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

1. Provision the resources defined in the `deploy.tf` configuration file. (Confirm the action by entering `yes` at the prompt.)

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell window.

1. On the Azure portal main menu, select **Resource Groups**.

    ![Azure portal Resource Groups](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/resource-groups-menu-option.png)

1. On the **Resource Groups** tab, select **slotDemoResourceGroup**.

    ![Resource group created by Terraform](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/resource-group.png)

When finished, you see all the resources created by Terraform.

## Fork the test project

Before you can test the creation and swapping in and out of the deployment slots, you need to fork the test project from GitHub.

1. Browse to the [awesome-terraform repo on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-terraform).

1. Fork the **awesome-terraform repo**.

    ![Fork the GitHub awesome-terraform repo](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/fork-repo.png)

1. Follow any prompts to fork to your environment.

## Deploy from GitHub to your deployment slots

Once you fork the test project repo, configure the deployment slots via the following steps:

1. On the Azure portal main menu, select **Resource Groups**.

1. Select **slotDemoResourceGroup**.

1. Select **slotAppService**.

1. Select **Deployment options**.

    ![Deployment options for an App Service resource](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/deployment-options.png)

1. On the **Deployment option** tab, select **Choose Source**, and then select **GitHub**.

    ![Select deployment source](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/select-source.png)

1. After Azure makes the connection and displays all the options, select **Authorization**.

1. On the **Authorization** tab, select **Authorize**, and supply the credentials needed for Azure to access your GitHub account. 

1. After Azure validates your GitHub credentials, a message displays indicating that the authorization process has completed. Select **OK** to close the **Authorization** tab.

1. Select **Choose your organization** and select your organization.

1. Select **Choose project**.

1. On the **Choose project** tab, select the **awesome-terraform** project.

    ![Choose the awesome-terraform project](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/choose-project.png)

1. Select **Choose branch**.

1. On the **Choose branch** tab, select **master**.

    ![Choose the master branch](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/choose-branch-master.png)

1. On the **Deployment option** tab, select **OK**.

At this point, you have deployed the production slot. To deploy the staging slot, perform all of the previous steps in this section with only the following modifications:

- In step 3, **slotAppServiceSlotOne** resource.

- In step 13, select the "working" branch instead of the master branch.

    ![Choose Working Branch](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/choose-branch-working.png)

## Test the app deployments

In the previous sections, you set up two slots - **slotAppService** and **slotAppServiceSlotOne** - to deploy from different branches in GitHub. Let's preview the web apps to validate that they were successfully deployed.

Perform the following steps two times where in step 3 you select **slotAppService** the first time, and then select **slotAppServiceSlotOne** the second time:

1. On the Azure portal main menu, select **Resource Groups**.

1. Select **slotDemoResourceGroup**.

1. Select either **slotAppService** or **slotAppServiceSlotOne**.

1. On the overview page, select **URL**.

    ![Select the URL on the overview tab to render the app](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/resource-url.png)

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several minutes for Azure to build and deploy the site from GitHub.
>
>

For the **slotAppService** web app, you see a blue page with a page title of **Slot Demo App 1**. For the **slotAppServiceSlotOne** web app, you see a green page with a page title of **Slot Demo App 2**.

## Swap the two deployment slots

To test swapping the two deployment slots, perform the following steps:
 
1. Switch to the browser tab running **slotAppService** (the app with the blue page). 

1. Return to the Azure portal in a separate tab.

1. Open the Cloud Shell.

1. Change directories to the **clouddrive/swap** directory.

    ```bash
    cd clouddrive/swap
    ```

1. Using the vi editor, create a file named `swap.tf`.

    ```bash
    vi swap.tf
    ```

1. Enter insert mode by pressing the letter `i` key.

1. Paste the following code into the editor:

    ```JSON
    # Configure the Azure Provider
    provider "azurerm" { }

    # Swap the production slot and the staging slot
    resource "azurerm_app_service_active_slot" "slotDemoActiveSlot" {
        resource_group_name   = "slotDemoResourceGroup"
        app_service_name      = "slotAppService"
        app_service_slot_name = "slotappServiceSlotOne"
    }
    ```

1. Press the **&lt;Esc>** key to exit insert mode.

1. Save the file and exit the vi editor by entering the following command, followed by pressing **&lt;Enter>**:

    ```bash
    :wq
    ```

1. Initialize Terraform.

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

1. Create the Terraform plan.

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

1. Provision the resources defined in the `swap.tf` configuration file. (Confirm the action by entering `yes` at the prompt.)

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

1. Once Terraform has finished swapping the slots, return to the browser that is rendering the **slotAppService** web app and refresh the page. 

The web app in your **slotAppServiceSlotOne** staging slot has been swapped with the production slot and now renders green. 

![The deployment slots have been swapped](./media/terraform-slot-walkthru/slots-swapped.png)

To return to the original production version of the app, reapply the Terraform plan created from the `swap.tf` configuration file.

```bash
terraform apply
```

Once swapped, you see the original configuration.
