# Tutorial: Optimize centrally-managed Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server

This tutorial guides you through proactively assigning SQL Server licenses in Azure to centrally manage and optimize [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/). Optimizing your benefit reduces the costs of running Azure SQL.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Gather license usage and availability details
> * Buy more licenses if needed
> * Assign licenses to Azure
> * Monitor usage and adjust
> * Establish a management schedule

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you:

Have read and understand the [What is centrally-managed Azure Hybrid Benefit?](overview-azure-hybrid-benefit-scope.md) article. The article explains the types of SQL Server licenses that quality for Azure Hybrid Benefit It also explains how to enable and use Azure Hybrid Benefit at your selected scope at the subscription or overall billing account level.

> [!NOTE]
> Managing Azure Hybrid Benefit centrally at a scope-level is currently in public preview and limited to enterprise customers.

Verify that your self-installed virtual machines running SQL Server in Azure are registered before you start to use the new experience. Doing so ensures that Azure resources that are running SQL Server are visible to you and Azure. For more information about registering SQL VMs in Azure, see [Register SQL Server VM with SQL IaaS Agent Extension](../../azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) and [Register multiple SQL VMs in Azure with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](../../azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-agent-extension-manually-register-vms-bulk.md).

## Gather license usage and availability details

_The first step is preparation._ Engage other departments in your organization to understand two things:

- What is your current and planned Azure SQL and SQL Server usage for the upcoming year?
- How many SQL Server core licenses are available to assign to Azure?

Next, determine your current _and planned_ Azure SQL usage for the upcoming year or other extended timeframe (at least a month).

Your Azure SQL usage details are shown when you [create SQL Server license assignments for Azure Hybrid Benefit](create-sql-license-assignments.md).

We recommend that you consult the appropriate people in your organization to validate the information above. Including, your _planned_ usage and expected SQL Server usage growth. There might be a centralized person or group that owns such planning, or it might be distributed across several teams.

An optional, but useful, method to investigate your Azure SQL usage (including usage of Azure Hybrid Benefit at the resource level) is to use the Azure Hybrid Benefit [sql-license-usage PowerShell script](https://github.com/anosov1960/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/manage/azure-hybrid-benefit). It analyzes and tracks the combined SQL Server license usage of all the SQL resources in a specific subscription or an entire account.

### Determine the number of SQL Server core licenses available to assign to Azure

The quantity depends on how many licenses that you purchased and how many are already in use between your on-premises servers and Azure VMs.

You have 180 days of dual use rights for the SQL Server license to ensure migrations are running seamlessly. After the 180-day period, you can only use the SQL Server license in Azure. Consider that point when you plan for license availability. For example, migrating licenses can be considered as licenses available to assign.

Your software procurement or software asset management department is likely to have this information.

## Buy more licenses if needed

After reviewing the information gathered, if you're sure that the number of SQL Server licenses available is insufficient to cover planned Azure SQL usage, then talk to your procurement department to buy more SQL Server core licenses with Software Assurance (or subscription licenses).

Buying SQL Server licenses and applying Azure Hybrid Benefit is less expensive than paying for SQL Server by the hour in Azure. By purchasing enough licenses to cover all planned Azure SQL usage, your organization will maximize cost savings from the benefit.

## Assign licenses to Azure

1. Follow the instructions in the Azure portal and documentation to select at least one scope and assign SQL Server licenses to them. For more information, see [Create SQL Server license assignments for Azure Hybrid Benefit](create-sql-license-assignments.md).
2. As you assign licenses, review the detected Azure SQL usage again to verify that the details are consistent with other information gathered.

## Monitor usage and adjust

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Reservations + Hybrid Benefits**.
1. A table is shown that includes the Azure Hybrid Benefit licenses assignments that you've made and the utilization percentage of each one.
1. If any of the utilization percentages are 100%, that means your organization is paying hourly rates for some SQL Server resources. Engage with other groups in your organization again to confirm whether current usage levels are temporary or if they'll continue. If the latter, your organization should consider purchasing more licenses and assigning them to Azure to reduce cost.
1. If utilization approaches 100%, but doesn't exceed it, determine whether usage is expected to rise in the near term. If so, you can proactively acquire and assign more licenses.

## Establish a management schedule

The preceding section discusses ongoing monitoring. We also recommend that you establish an annual or quarterly schedule that you follow repeatedly. The schedule includes the major steps described in the article:

- Gather license usage and availability details.
- Buy more licenses if needed to cover upcoming usage growth.
- Assign licenses to Azure.
- Monitor usage and adjust on the fly, as needed.
- Repeat the process every year or at whatever frequency best suits your needs.

## Example walkthrough

In the following example, assume that you're the billing administrator for the Contoso Insurance company. You manage Contoso's Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server.

You're informed by your procurement department that you can centrally manage Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL server at an overall account level. Procurement learned about it from their Microsoft account team. You're interested because it's been challenging to manage Azure Hybrid Benefit lately. In part, because your developers have been enabling the benefit (or not) arbitrarily on resources as they share scripts with each other.

You locate the new Azure Hybrid Benefit experience in the Cost Management + Billing area of the Azure portal.

After you've read the preceding instructions in the article, you understand that:

  - Contoso needs to register SQL Server VMs before taking other actions.
  - The ideal way to use the new capability is to assign licenses proactively to cover expected usage.

Then, do the following steps.

1. Use the preceding instructions to make sure self-installed SQL VMs are registered. They include talking to subscription owners to complete the registration for the subscriptions where you don't have sufficient permissions.
1. You review Azure resource usage data from recent months and you talk to others in Contoso. You determine that 2000 SQL Server Enterprise Edition and 750 SQL Server Standard Edition core licenses, or 8750 normalized core licenses, are needed to cover expected Azure SQL usage for the next year. Expected usage also includes migrating workloads (1500 SQL Server Enterprise Edition + 750 SQL Server Standard Edition = 6750 normalized) and net new Azure SQL workloads (another 500 SQL Server Enterprise Edition or 2000 normalized core licenses).
1. Next, confirm with your with procurement team that the needed licenses are already available or will soon be purchased. The confirmation ensures that the licenses are available to assign to Azure.
   - Licenses you have in use on premises can be considered available to assign to Azure if the associated workloads are being migrated to Azure. As mentioned previously, Azure Hybrid Benefit allows dual use for up to 180 days.
   - You determine that there are 1800 SQL Server Enterprise Edition licenses and 2000 SQL Server Standard Edition licenses available to assign to Azure. The available licenses equal 9200 normalized core licenses. That's a little more than the 8750 needed (2000 x 4 + 750 = 8750).
1. Then, you assign the 1800 SQL Server Enterprise Edition and 2000 SQL Server Standard Edition to Azure. That action results in 9200 normalized core licenses that you can apply to Azure SQL resources as they run each hour. Assigning more licenses than are required now provides a buffer if usage grows faster than you expect.

Afterward, you monitor assigned license usage periodically, ideally monthly. After 10 months, usage approaches 95%, indicating faster Azure SQL usage growth than you expected. You talk to your procurement team to get more licenses so that you can assign them.

Lastly, you adopt an annual license review schedule. In the review process, you:

- Gather and analyze license usage data.
- Confirm license availability.
- Work with your procurement team to get more licenses, if needed.
- Update license assignments.
- Monitor over time.
