# Automate resizing uploaded images using Event Grid

[Azure Event Grid](overview.md) is an eventing service for the cloud. Event Grid enables you to create subscriptions to events raised by Azure services or third-party resources.  In this article, Event Grid enables [Azure Functions](..\azure-functions\functions-overview.md) to respond to [Azure Blob storage](..\storage\blobs\storage-blobs-introduction.md) events and generate thumbnails of uploaded images. An event subscription is created against the Blob storage create event, which in turn calls a function endpoint. Data passed to the function binding from Event Grid is used to access the blob and generate the thumbnail image. You use the Azure CLI to create and configure the application topology and test it by using a sample web app.   

> [!WARNING]
> This tutorial requires Event Grid functionality that is currently in a reduced-access preview. To be able to successfully complete this topic, you must first [request access to Blob storage events](#request-storage-access).  
>
>After access is granted, an email is sent to the user who requested access. You can also [check your approval status](#check-access-status) from the Azure CLI.  
>
>After you have confirmed that your subscription has been granted access to Blob storage events, you can [complete the rest of this tutorial](#create-rg).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create Azure Storage accounts
> * Define blob containers in Blob storage
> * Deploy serverless code using Azure Functions
> * Create a Blob storage event subscription in Event Grid
> * Deploy a web app to Azure
> * Enable a CORS origin in Storage

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

+ You must have an active Azure subscription.
+ You must apply for and have been granted access to the Blob storage events functionality. [Request access to Blob storage events](#request-storage-access) before continuing with the other steps in the topic.  

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

If you are not using Cloud Shell, you must first sign in using `az login`.

## Enable Blob storage events

At this time, you must request access to the Blob storage events feature. 

### <a name="request-storage-access"></a>Request access to Blob storage events

You request access with the `az feature register` command.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We are accepting Blob storage events preview participants in the order they requested to join. You might experience a delay in being granted access to this feature. We are currently processing requests submitted on August 31.

```azurecli-interactive
az feature register --name storageEventSubscriptions --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid
```

### <a name="check-access-status"></a>Check your approval status

You will receive an email from Microsoft notifying you that you have been granted access to Blob storage events. You can verify the status of your access request at any time with the `az feature show` command.

```azurecli-interactive
az feature show --name storageEventSubscriptions --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid --query properties.state
```
After you have been granted access to the Blob storage events feature, this command returns a `"Registered"` value. 
 
After you are registered, you can continue with this tutorial.

## <a name="create-rg"></a>Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like topics and subscriptions, function apps, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.

The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup`.  

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westcentralus
```

## Create Azure Storage accounts

The sample uploads images to a blob container in an Azure Storage account. Create a storage account in the resource group you created by using the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#create) command.

Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Event subscriptions for blob storage are currently only supported for Blob storage accounts. Because of this, you must create two accounts: a Blob storage account used by the sample app to store images and thumbnails, and a general storage account required by Azure Functions.  
>
>You are also currently restricted to Blob storage accounts in the West Central US region. 

In the following command, substitute your own globally unique name for the Blob storage account where you see the `<blob_storage_account>` placeholder. 

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create --name <blob_storage_account> \
--location westcentralus --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--sku Standard_LRS --kind blobstorage --access-tier hot
```
In the following command, substitute your own globally unique name for the general storage account where you see the `<general_storage_account>` placeholder. 

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create --name <general_storage_account> \
--location westcentralus --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--sku Standard_LRS --kind storage
```
## Create Blob storage containers

The app uses two containers in the Blob storage account. The _images_ container is used to upload full-resolution images. The function uploads resized image thumbnails to the _thumbs_ container. Get the storage account key by using the [storage account keys list](/cli/azure/storage/account/keys#list) command. You then use this key to create two containers using the [az storage container create](/cli/azure/storage/container#create) command. 

In this case, `<blob_storage_account>` is the name of the Blob storage account you created.

```azurecli-interactive
blobStorageAccount=<blob_storage_account>

blobStorageAccountKey=$(az storage account keys list -g myResourceGroup \
-n $blobStorageAccount --query [0].value --output tsv)

az storage container create -n images --account-name $blobStorageAccount \
--account-key $blobStorageAccountKey

az storage container create -n thumbs --account-name $blobStorageAccount \
--account-key $blobStorageAccountKey

echo "Make a note of your blob storage account key..."
echo $blobStorageAccountKey
```
Make a note of your blob storage account name and key. The sample app uses these settings to connect to the storage account to upload images.

## Create a function app  

You must have a function app to host the execution of your functions. The function app provides an environment for serverless execution of your function code. Create a function app by using the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#create) command. 

In the following command, substitute your own unique function app name where you see the `<function_app_name>` placeholder. The `<function_app>` is used as the default DNS domain for the function app, and so the name needs to be unique across all apps in Azure. In this case, `<general_storage_account>` is the name of the general storage account you created.  

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --name <function_app> --storage-account  <general_storage_account>  \
--resource-group myResourceGroup --consumption-plan-location westcentralus
```

Now you must configure the function app to connect to blob storage. 

## Configure the function app

The function needs the connection string to connect to the blob storage account. In this case, `<blob_storage_account>` is the name of the Blob storage account you created. Get the connection string with the [az storage account show-connection-string](/cli/azure/storage/account#show-connection-string) command. The thumbnail image container name must also be set to `thumbs`. Add these application settings in the function app with the [az functionapp config appsettings set](/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#set) command.

```azurecli-interactive
storageConnectionString=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
--resource-group myResourceGroup --name <blob_storage_account> \
--query connectionString --output tsv)

az functionapp config appsettings set --name <function_app> \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--settings myblobstorage_STORAGE=$storageConnectionString \
myContainerName=thumbs
```

You can now deploy a function code project to this function app.

## Deploy the function code 

The C# function that performs image resizing is available in this [sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/function-image-upload-resize). Deploy this Functions project code to the function app by using the [az functionapp deployment source config](/cli/azure/functionapp/deployment/source#config) command. 

In the following command, `<function_app>` is the same function app you created in the previous script.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp deployment source config --name <function_app> \
--resource-group myResourceGroup --branch master --manual-integration \
--repo-url https://github.com/Azure-Samples/function-image-upload-resize
```

This function is triggered by an event subscription to a Blob created event. The data passed to the trigger includes the URL of the blob, which is used to retrieve the image from Blob storage. The function generates a thumbnail image and writes the resulting stream to a separate container in Blob storage. To learn more about this function, see the [readme file in the sample repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/function-image-upload-resize/blob/master/README.md).
 
The function project code is deployed directly from the public sample repo. To learn more about deployment options for Azure Functions, see [Continuous deployment for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment.md).

## Create an event subscription 

An event subscription tells Event Grid which provider-generated events you want to send to a specific endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is exposed by your function. Use the following steps to create an event subscription from your function in the Azure portal: 

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), click the arrow at the bottom left to expand all services, type `functions` in the **Filter** field, and then choose **Function Apps**. 

![Browse to Function Apps in the Azure portal](./media/resize-images-on-storage-blob-upload-event/portal-find-functions.png)

Expand your function app, choose your function, and then select **Add Event Grid subscription**.

![Browse to Function Apps in the Azure portal](./media/resize-images-on-storage-blob-upload-event/add-event-subscription.png)

Use the event subscription settings as specified in the table.

![Create event subscription from the function in the Azure portal](./media/resize-images-on-storage-blob-upload-event/event-subscription-create-flow.png)

| Setting      | Suggested value  | Description                                        |
| ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name** | myFuncSub | Name that identifies your new event subscription. | 
| **Topic type** |  Storage accounts | Choose the Storage account event provider. | 
| **Subscription** | Your subscription | By default, your current subscription should be selected.   |
| **Resource group** | myResourceGroup | Select **Use existing** and choose the resource group you have been using in this topic.  |
| **Instance** |  `<blob_storage_account>` |  Choose the Blob storage account you created. |
| **Event types** | Blob created | Uncheck all types other than **Blob created**. Only event types of `Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated` are passed to the function.| 
| **Subscriber endpoint** | autogenerated | Use the endpoint URL that is generated for you. | 
| **Prefix filter** | /blobServices/default/containers/images/blobs/ | Filters storage events to only those on the **images** container.| 

Click **Create** to add the event subscription.

Now that the backend services are configured, you publish the sample web app to Azure. 

## Create an App Service plan

An [App Service plan](../app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md) specifies the location, size, and features of the web server farm that hosts your app.
Create an App Service plan with the [az appservice plan create](/cli/azure/appservice/plan#create) command.

The following example creates an App Service plan named `myAppServicePlan` in the **Free** pricing tier:

```azurecli-interactive
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan  --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku FREE
```

## Create a web app

The web app provides a hosting space for the sample app code that is deployed from the GitHub sample repository. Create a [web app](../app-service-web/app-service-web-overview.md) in the `myAppServicePlan` App Service plan with the [az webapp create](/cli/azure/webapp#create) command. 

In the following command, replace *\<app_name>* with a unique name (valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`). If `<web_app>` is not unique, you get the error message: _Website with given name <web_app> already exists._ The default URL of the web app is `https://<web_app>.azurewebsites.net`. 

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp create --name <web_app> --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan
```

## Deploy the sample app from the GitHub repository

App Service supports several ways to deploy content to a web app. In this tutorial, you deploy the web app from this [sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/integration-image-resize-web-app). Configure a one-time GitHub deployment to the web app with the [az webapp deployment source config](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment/source#config) command. 

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp deployment source config --name <web_app>  \
--resource-group myResourceGroup --branch master --manual-integration \
--repo-url https://github.com/Azure-Samples/integration-image-resize-web-app
```

## Configure web app settings

The sample web app uses the Azure Storage SDK to request access tokens, which are used to upload images. The storage account credentials used by the Storage SDK are set in the application settings for the web app. Add application settings to the deployed app with the [az webapp config appsettings set](/cli/azure/webapp/config/appsettings#set) command.

In the following command, `<blob_storage_account>` is the name of your Blob storage account and `<blob_storage_key>` is the associated key. You obtained this key during a previous step.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <web_app> --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--settings AzureStorageConfig__AccountName=<blob_storage_account> \
AzureStorageConfig__ImageContainer=images  \
AzureStorageConfig__ThumbnailContainer=thumbs \
AzureStorageConfig__AccountKey=<blob_storage_key> 
```

## Enable CORS access from the web app

The web app uses a JavaScript client to download thumbnail images from blob storage. For more information about the web app architecture, see the [sample readme](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/integration-image-resize-web-app/blob/master/README.md). To enable JavaScript requests from the web app, you must add a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) exception for the web app. Add an origin with the [az storage cors add](/cli/azure/storage/cors#add) command.

In the following command, `<blob_storage_account>` is the name of your Blob storage account.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage cors add --methods GET PUT OPTIONS --exposed-headers content-length \
--allowed-headers "*" --origins "*" --services b \
--account-name <blob_storage_account> 
```
After the web app is deployed and configured, you can test the entire image upload and resizing functionality in the app.

## Test the sample app

To test the web app, browse to the URL of your published app. The default URL of the web app is `https://<web_app>.azurewebsites.net>`.

Click the **Upload photos** region to select and upload a file. 

Notice that a thumbnail copy of the uploaded image is displayed in the **Generated thumbnails** carousel. This image was resized by the function, added to the thumbs container, and downloaded by the web client.

## Clean up resources

After you complete this topic, you can remove the resources you created. Use the following command to delete all resources created by this tutorial:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
Type `y` when prompted.
