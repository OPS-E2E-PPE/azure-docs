# Use simplified compute node communication

An Azure Batch pool contains one or more compute nodes that execute user-specified workloads in the form of Batch tasks. To enable Batch functionality and Batch pool infrastructure management, compute nodes must communicate with the Azure Batch service.

Batch supports two types of node communication modes:
- `Classic` where the Batch service initiates communication to the compute nodes
- `Simplified` where the compute nodes initiate communication to the Batch service

This document describes the simplified compute node communication mode and the associated network configuration requirements.

> [!TIP]
> Information in this document pertaining to networking resources and rules such as NSGs does not apply to
> Batch pools with [no public IP addresses](simplified-node-communication-pool-no-public-ip.md) using the
> node management private endpoint without Internet outbound access.

## Supported regions

Simplified compute node communication in Azure Batch is currently available for the following regions:

- Public: all public regions where Batch is present except for West India and France South.

- Government: USGov Arizona, USGov Virginia, USGov Texas.

- China: all China regions where Batch is present except for China North 1 and China East 1.

## Compute node communication differences between Classic and Simplified

The simplified compute node communication mode streamlines the way Batch pool infrastructure is
managed on behalf of users. This communication mode reduces the complexity and scope of inbound
and outbound networking connections required in baseline operations.

Batch pools with the `classic` communication mode require the following networking rules in network
security groups (NSGs), user-defined routes (UDRs), and firewalls when
[creating a pool in a virtual network](batch-virtual-network.md):

- Inbound:
  - Destination ports 29876, 29877 over TCP from BatchNodeManagement.*region*

- Outbound:
  - Destination port 443 over TCP to Storage.*region*
  - Destination port 443 over TCP to BatchNodeManagement.*region* for certain workloads that require communication back to the Batch Service, such as Job Manager tasks

Batch pools with the `simplified` communication mode require the following networking rules in
NSGs, UDRs, and firewalls:

- Inbound:
  - None

- Outbound:
  - Destination port 443 over ANY to BatchNodeManagement.*region*

Outbound requirements for a Batch account can be discovered using the
[List Outbound Network Dependencies Endpoints API](/rest/api/batchmanagement/batch-account/list-outbound-network-dependencies-endpoints)
This API will report the base set of dependencies, depending upon the Batch account pool communication mode.
User-specific workloads may need extra rules such as opening traffic to other Azure resources (such as Azure
Storage for Application Packages, Azure Container Registry, etc.) or endpoints like the Microsoft package
repository for virtual file system mounting functionality.

## Benefits of the simplified communication mode

Azure Batch users utilizing the simplified mode benefit from simplification of networking connections and
rules. Simplified compute node communication helps reduce security risks by removing the requirement to open
ports for inbound communication from the internet. Only a single outbound rule to a well-known Service Tag is
required for baseline operation.

The `simplified` mode also provides more fine-grained data exfiltration control over the `classic`
communication mode since outbound communication to Storage.*region* is no longer required. You can
explicitly lock down outbound communication to Azure Storage if necessary for your workflow. For
example, you can scope your outbound communication rules to Azure Storage to enable your AppPackage
storage accounts or other storage accounts for resource files or output files.

Even if your workloads aren't currently impacted by the changes (as described in the next section), it's
recommended to move to the `simplified` mode. Doing so will ensure your Batch workloads are ready for any
future improvements enabled by this mode, and also for when this communication mode will move to become
the default.

## Potential impact between classic and simplified communication modes

In many cases, the `simplified` communication mode won't directly affect your Batch workloads. However,
simplified compute node communication will have an impact for the following cases:

- Users who specify a Virtual Network as part of creating a Batch pool and do one or both of the following actions:
   - Explicitly disable outbound network traffic rules that are incompatible with simplified compute node communication.
   - Use UDRs and firewall rules that are incompatible with simplified compute node communication.
- Users who enable software firewalls on compute nodes and explicitly disable outbound traffic in software firewall rules that are incompatible with simplified compute node communication.

If either of these cases applies to you, then follow the steps outlined in the next section to ensure that
your Batch workloads can still function under the `simplified` mode. We strongly recommend that you test and
verify all of your changes in a dev and test environment first before pushing your changes into production.

### Required network configuration changes for simplified communication mode

The following set of steps is required to migrate to the new communication mode:

1. Ensure your networking configuration as applicable to Batch pools (NSGs, UDRs, firewalls, etc.) includes a union of the modes (that is, the combined network rules of both `classic` and `simplified` modes). At a minimum, these rules would be:
   - Inbound:
     - Destination ports 29876, 29877 over TCP from BatchNodeManagement.*region*
   - Outbound:
     - Destination port 443 over TCP to Storage.*region*
     - Destination port 443 over ANY to BatchNodeManagement.*region*
1. If you have any other inbound or outbound scenarios required by your workflow, you'll need to ensure that your rules reflect these requirements.
1. Use one of the following options to update your workloads to use the new communication mode.
   - Create new pools with the `targetNodeCommunicationMode` set to `simplified` and validate that the new pools are working correctly. Migrate your workload to the new pools and delete any earlier pools.
   - Update existing pools `targetNodeCommunicationMode` property to `simplified` and then resize all existing pools to zero nodes and scale back out.
1. Use the [Get Pool](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/get), [List Pool](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/list) API or Portal to confirm the `currentNodeCommunicationMode` is set to the desired communication mode of `simplified`.
1. Modify all applicable networking configuration to the Simplified Compute Node Communication rules, at the minimum (note any extra rules needed as discussed above):
   - Inbound:
     - None
   - Outbound:
     - Destination port 443 over ANY to BatchNodeManagement.*region*

If you follow these steps, but later want to switch back to `classic` compute node communication, you'll need to take the following actions:

1. Create new pools or update existing pools `targetNodeCommunicationMode` property set to `classic`.
1. Migrate your workload to these pools, or resize existing pools and scale back out (see step 3 above).
1. See step 4 above to confirm that your pools are operating in `classic` communication mode.
1. Optionally revert your networking configuration.

## Specifying the node communication mode on a Batch pool

Below are examples of how to create a Batch pool with `simplified` compute node communication.

> [!TIP]
> Specifying the target node communication mode is a preference indication for the Batch service and not a guarantee that it
> will be honored. Certain configurations on the pool may prevent the Batch service from honoring the specified target node
> communication mode, such as interaction with No public IP address, virtual networks, and the pool configuration type.

### Azure portal

Navigate to the Pools blade of your Batch account and click the Add button. Under `OPTIONAL SETTINGS`, you can
select `Simplified` as an option from the pull-down of `Node communication mode` as shown below.

To update an existing pool to simplified communication mode, navigate to the Pools blade of your Batch account and
click on the pool to update. On the left-side navigation, select `Node communication mode`. There you'll be able
to select a new target node communication mode as shown below. After selecting the appropriate communication mode,
click the `Save` button to update. You'll need to scale the pool down to zero nodes first, and then back out
for the change to take effect, if conditions allow.

To display the current node communication mode for a pool, navigate to the Pools blade of your Batch account, and
click on the pool to view. Select `Properties` on the left-side navigation and the pool node communication mode
will be shown under the General section.

## Limitations

The following are known limitations of the `simplified` communication mode:

- Limited migration support for previously created pools without public IP addresses
([V1 preview](batch-pool-no-public-ip-address.md)). These pools can only be migrated if created in a
[virtual network](batch-virtual-network.md), otherwise they won't use simplified compute node communication, even
if specified on the pool. For more information, see the
[migration guide](batch-pools-without-public-ip-addresses-classic-retirement-migration-guide.md).
- Cloud Service Configuration pools are currently not supported for simplified compute node communication and are
[deprecated](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-batch-cloudserviceconfiguration-pools-will-be-retired-on-29-february-2024/).
Specifying a communication mode for these types of pools aren't honored and will always result in `classic`
communication mode. We recommend using Virtual Machine Configuration for your Batch pools. For more information, see
[Migrate Batch pool configuration from Cloud Services to Virtual Machine](batch-pool-cloud-service-to-virtual-machine-configuration.md).
