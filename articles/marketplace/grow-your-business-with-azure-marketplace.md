# Grow your business in the Marketplace 
After you've published your offer on AppSource or in the Azure Marketplace, you can use your listing as a launchpad for joint go-to-market (GTM) activities with Microsoft. Driving traffic to your Marketplace offer and nurturing Marketplace leads, for example, are great ways to accelerate your business growth. 

In this article, we share many marketing best practices for growing your business in the Marketplace.

## App listing best practices

The tables in the next sections provide suggestions for creating engaging Marketplace offers. To write and configure your marketing materials, go to the [Cloud Partner portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights). 

### Storefront offer details
| Storefront setting | Best practice |
|:--- |:--- |  
| Offer Name | Provide a strong title:<br>Your app name should communicate the core value that your customers receive. Including search keywords in your app title can help your app to be ranked higher in search engine results.<br><br>Follow a set title format for consulting service listings:<br>[Offer Name]: [Duration] [Offer Type] (for example, *Contoso: 2-Week Implementation*)<br><br>Adhere to brand guidelines:<br>Follow [Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general.aspx) and other relevant, product-specific guidelines when you refer to Microsoft trademarks and the names of Microsoft software, products, and services. |
| Offer Description | Provide a clear offer description:<br>Clearly describe your offer's value proposition in the first few sentences of your description. Keep in mind that the first few sentences might be displayed in search engine results. Do not rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Instead, focus on the value you deliver. Use industry-specific vocabulary or benefit-based wording as much as possible.<br><br>Core components of your value proposition should include the following information:<ul><li>Description of the product</li><li>Type of user that benefits from the product</li><li>Customer need or pain that the product addresses</li></ul> |

### Storefront listing details
| Storefront setting | Best practice |
|:--- |:--- |  
| Industries: AppSource apps and consulting services only | Select industries if your offer addresses industry-specific requirements:<br>Call out industry-specific capabilities in your offer description.<br><br>**Note**: The maximum number of options varies by offer type and is indicated in the Cloud Partner portal. |
| Categories | Select categories that align best with your offer:<br>Choose the categories carefully, because customers use them to search for relevant apps. Be sure to call out how your offer supports category-specific needs in the offer description.<br><br> **Note**: The maximum number of options varies by offer type and is indicated in the Cloud Partner portal. |
| Products that your app works with (3&nbsp;max): AppSource apps only | List additional products and technologies that your solution uses or extends:<br>For example, Azure IoT Hub or Azure Machine Learning. |
| Search keywords (3&nbsp;max) | Use search keywords that help business users find your offer when they search in the Azure Marketplace and on AppSource or by using search engines:<br>Identify the top three search keywords for your offer; incorporate the search keywords in your offer summary and description; and list the search keywords here. |

### Storefront marketing details
| Storefront setting | Best practice |
|:--- |:--- |  
| Offer logo (PNG format, 48&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;48): search page | Design and optimize your logo for a digital medium:<br>Upload the logo in PNG format to the search page of your offer. |
| Offer logo (PNG format, 216&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;216): app details page | Design and optimize your logo for a digital medium:<br>Upload the logo in PNG format to the app details listing page of your offer. |
| "Learn more" documents | Include supporting sales and marketing assets under "Learn more":<br>For example, white papers, brochures, checklists, or PowerPoint presentations. Save all files in PDF format. Your goal should be to educate customers, not sell to them.<br><br>Add a link to your app landing page to all your documents, and add URL parameters to help you track visitors and trials. |
| Videos: AppSource, consulting services, and SaaS offers only | The strongest videos communicate the value of your offer in narrative form:<br>Make your customer, not your company, the hero of the story. Your video should address the principal challenges and goals of your target customer.<br><br>Recommended length: 60-90 seconds.<br><br>Incorporate key search words that use the name of the videos.<br><br>Consider adding additional videos, such as a how-to, getting started, or customer testimonial video. |
| Screenshots (1280&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;720) | Add up to five screenshots:<br>Incorporate key search words in the file names. |

## Marketing best practices 

To help you maximize the benefit of listing in the Marketplace, we collected the following best practices for marketing offers on AppSource and in the Azure Marketplace. First, be sure to review the marketing best practices and resources on the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN). This site is your gateway for all marketing and programmatic resources related to partnering with Microsoft.

In addition, the quality of your Marketplace offer and your commitment to customer-centric demand generation help drive growth for your business. Engaging in these activities helps Microsoft amplify your GTM work and feature key solutions across the storefronts in the Marketplace.

After youâ€™ve created a great listing, the following marketing initiatives will help you grow your business:

* Build a strong value proposition.<br>Identify your potential customer and the key differentiators of your solution.

* Create a unique landing page on your site to make your app listing stand out.<br>Drive traffic from your site to your offer and make a great first impression. Based on your offer listing, customers decide whether they want to learn more and try your solutions.

* Enable a test drive or other trial experience.<br>Users want to experience your app firsthand. Publishers have historically seen much higher lead conversion rates from listings that offer a test drive or trial.

* Optimize your listing to help boost search engine rankings.<br>Incorporate search keywords in your app name, summary, and listing. 

* Enable lead sharing.<br>Obtain your customers' contact information when they try your app right in your CRM system. Make sure you have a process in place to follow up on these new leads.

* Build your demand-generation plan.<br>Use your Marketplace offer listing as the landing page for marketing calls to action. If you've enabled lead sharing, each time customers try, test drive, or deploy your offer from the landing page, you obtain their name and contact information.

* Promote your app on AppSource and/or in the Azure Marketplace.<br>Link to your app listing, and use URL tagging each time you link to your app.

* Create marketing and promotion campaigns.<br>Plan and build campaigns to drive awareness and engagement, with a clear call to action that directs traffic to your Marketplace listing.

* Get customer feedback.<br>Invite your customers to submit a rating and review of your listing site. After they've started a trial, they receive an email message inviting them to share their experience with other customers.

* Get actionable insights.<br>View the Insights dashboard in the [Cloud Partner portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights). Track how many visitors your app listing gets, and how many try your app. Learn details about the performance of your marketing campaigns and which content performs best.

* Use GTM services benefits.<br>Take full advantage of our GTM services. [Learn more about benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/reach-customers/gtm) that are available through the MPN.

## Build an effective marketing campaign

A marketing campaign is a series of promotional activities or marketing tactics that are aimed at driving your audience to a desired action or outcome. As you're designing your campaign, consider the following best practices:

### Know your audience
First, determine the actual buyer versus the purchase influencer. They might be different people within an organization, and your tactics and calls to action for each role might differ. Ask these evaluation questions to help you better understand your audience:

* How much control does the buyer have over the purchasing decision?
* How much influence does the influencer have?
* What does the influencer influence?
* Does this person influence budget or which solution is picked?

Knowing the answers to these questions helps you make decisions about where to invest your sales and marketing resources.

### Define where your audience learns
These days, typical customers are most of the way through their journey by the time they visit the Marketplace. Buyers get this far in the decision-making process by learning about solutions and assessing options in advance. You want to design a campaign that aims to be where your buyers and influencers learn about solutions well before they consider purchasing one.

The audience for each industry, vertical, or category is different. Does your audience learn online, through email, at trade shows, through social media, or through conversations with trusted advisors? Depending on where and how your audience learns, you should design activities and distribute your marketing dollars accordingly. The combination of these tactics becomes your campaign strategy.

### Create clear campaign goals
You should define success for your campaign in the Marketplace and create clear key performance indicators (KPIs). You can run multiple campaigns with different end goals, of course. The ultimate goal is usually increased revenue or customer acquisition; however, your marketing campaigns might be tied to goals at other stages of the buying cycle. Here are a few examples: 

* You have newly launched your product in the Marketplace. In this case, you might find that your marketing resources are best spent on audience education and lead generation. Success might be defined by the number of leads generated from your Marketplace listing. In this case, your marketing tactics (and landing page) would focus on drawing customers to your Marketplace listing.

* You have a trial set up in the Marketplace and your product requires some level of engagement and experience before a purchase takes place. Consider a campaign goal of the number of trials downloaded. In this case, the call to action for your campaign tactics would focus sharply on encouraging a trial in the Marketplace.

* Your product or category is well known, and you have purchase capabilities set up in the Marketplace. Consider skipping the trial call to action and direct your audience to your **Get It Now** link in the Marketplace.

* Your offer is established and mature. Consider focusing your campaign efforts on upselling your customer base and driving action toward increasing purchases in the Marketplace. Your messaging would focus on encouraging customers to purchase through the Marketplace. Your KPI could be the revenue that's generated through the Marketplace.

Whatever the maturity of your offer and the goals of your organization, the following are keys to maximizing the effectiveness of your campaign:
* Remain focused on the goals.
* Map out a set of integrated marketing tactics that are aligned to the goals.

As part of being a new publisher in the Marketplace, you receive some free Marketplace GTM benefits from Microsoft. Think critically about how to use these benefits in your campaign strategy. Let our marketing team know your Marketplace campaign goals and your desired audience action. Microsoft can help customize these deliverables to work into your plan.

For additional content about campaign building and marketing practices, be sure to engage in the [Smart Partner Marketing program](https://partner.microsoft.com/smart-partner-marketing), a benefit of joining the Microsoft Partner Network. 

### Invest in merchandising
As part of the publishing process, consider what type of offer to create, and choose a category for your offer on AppSource or in the Azure Marketplace. Be sure to select a category that's appropriate for your solution, so that it is displayed accurately to potential customers.

Marketplace featured offers are chosen based on which offer the best customer experience and take advantage of high-quality partner marketing engagement. The following criteria increase the likelihood that your solution becomes part of Marketplace featured offers:
* Clarity of the listing
* Quality of the solution
* Reliability of the technology
* Growth of platform usage by your customers
* Your level of engagement with creating high-quality marketing material

To maximize the likelihood that your offer is featured, invest in the success of your Marketplace offering. To ensure a great customer experience for your offer, consider the following approaches:
* Ensure that your marketing artifacts are uploaded and displayed correctly.
* Drive high-quality traffic to your offer in Marketplace by creating high-quality demand-generation campaigns.
* Grow the consumption of your AppSource or Azure Marketplace offers by driving demand, providing high-quality customer service, and providing timely updates on your offer.

For more information about how featured offers fit in the context of your GTM benefits, see [GTM Benefits in the Marketplace](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-benefits).

#### Merchandising badge
When your offer is listed on AppSource or in the Azure Marketplace, you have earned the benefit of displaying the _Available on AppSource_ or _Available on Azure Marketplace_ badge on your website.

The AppSource badge is available in three sizes. You can download the badge along with guidance on how to use it at [Promote the availability of your app on Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/promote-your-app-s-availability-on-microsoft-appsource).

The Azure Marketplace badge is provided as part of your free [go-to-market benefits](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-benefits?branch=master).

### Link to your app listing page in the Marketplace from your website
When you link from the AppSource or Azure Marketplace badge on your site to your listing in the Marketplace, support strong analytics and reporting by including the following query parameters at the end of the URL:
* **src**: Include the source from which the traffic is routed to AppSource (for example, website, LinkedIn, or Facebook).
* **mktcmpid**: Your marketing campaign ID, which can contain up to 16 characters in any combination of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (for example, *blogpost_12*).

The following example URL contains both of the preceding query parameters:
`https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?src=website&mktcmpid=blogpost_12`

By adding the parameters to your AppSource URL, you can review the effectiveness of your campaign in the analytics dashboard in the [Cloud Partner portal](http://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights). 

## Analytics and reporting

In the Insights section of the [Cloud Partner portal](http://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights), you can view a high-level performance overview of your offer. The best practice for working with the information in these reports is to reconcile it with your internal data. Use the information to help prioritize your marketing campaign actions.

The Analytics section of [Cloud Partner portal](http://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights) (currently in preview and available only for AppSource offers) provides a rich Power BI dashboard. You can use the dashboard to view traffic on the detail page of your offer. New features for this dashboard are rolled out in an ongoing way.

Also in the [Cloud Partner portal](http://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights) is documentation on Microsoft campaigns. You can use the documentation to set up and track your campaigns.

The following reports are included in the high-level performance overview section:
* Summary snapshot of orders
* Usage
* Deployments
* Customer trends on the Insights home page
* Detailed orders, usage, and customer data
* Orders and usage, shown as a monthly summary or as a six-month trend view
* Usage and orders broken out by several criteria

Detailed reports display customer information, such as company name and geographic location at the postal code level. Consider using this information to compare your customers or compensate your sellers. Microsoft provides the following attributes about your customers:
* Reseller
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Company Name
* Transaction Date
* Subscription Name
* Azure Subscription ID (pay-as-you-go customers only)
* Cloud Instance Name
* Order Count
* Customer Country Region
* Customer City
* Customer Communication Culture
* Customer ZIP Code

## Enable lead sharing 
Nurturing leads from the Marketplace is a key enabler for successful engagement with Marketplace users. Start by ensuring that lead management is enabled for your listing and configured correctly in your company CRM system. By doing so, you receive the signals and contact information for the users who interact with your listing in a queue to be processed for qualification. 

Use the following practices for your leads:

* Enrich Marketplace leads with additional data from your marketing and sales databases. A Marketplace customer might already be in one of your lead nurture systems from a prior marketing campaign or as an existing customer. 
* Score leads and use a variety of nurture paths for various actions in the Marketplace. A customer who tests your application is in a different stage than one who initiates a purchase, for example.
* Process leads data frequently. Recency of engagement with customers is a key driver for success. 
* Nurture your leads by using email or inside sales or pre-sales to ensure proper qualification before they enter your sales pipeline.
* Align your efforts with your overall marketing campaign strategy.

## Easier customer-usage attribution for Azure partners

As a software partner for Azure, your solutions either require Azure components or are deployed directly on Azure infrastructure. Today, when partner solutions are deployed by customers and use Azure resources that are provisioned by customers, it can be difficult to view the status of those deployments. It can also be difficult to access information about the impact to Azure growth. Such information helps you align with Microsoft sales teams and obtain credit for Microsoft partner programs.  

Microsoft is creating a new method to help partners better track Azure usage that results from customers' deploying your software on Azure. This new method is based on using Azure Resource Manager to orchestrate deployment of Azure services.

As a Microsoft partner, you can associate Azure usage with any Azure resources that you provision on a customer's behalf. You can make this association via the Azure Marketplace, the QuickStart repo, private GitHub repos, and even one-on-one customer engagements. To enable this, you can take either of two approaches:

* **Azure Resource Manager templates**: Use Azure Resource Manager templates or solution templates to deploy the Azure services to run your software. You can create templates that define the infrastructure and configuration of your Azure solution. They allow you and your customers to repeatedly deploy your solution throughout its lifecycle. You can be confident that your resources are deployed in consistently. 

* **Azure Resource Manager APIs**: You can call the Azure Resource Manager APIs directly to either deploy an Azure Resource Manager template or to generate the API calls to directly provision Azure services. 

## Method 1: Azure Resource Manager templates 
Today, many partner solutions are deployed on a customerâ€™s subscription by using Azure Resource Manager templates. If you already have a Azure Resource Manager template available in the Azure Marketplace, on GitHub, or as a QuickStart, the process of modifying your template to enable this new tracking method should be straightforward. If you are not using an Azure Resource Manager template today, here is some information to help you better understand Azure Resource Manager templates and how to create one: 

*	[Create and deploy your first Azure Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template)
*	[Guide to create a solution template for Azure Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-solution-template-creation)

### Add a GUID to your existing Azure Resource Manager template

Adding the GUID is a one-time modification of the main template file. To do so:
 1. Create a GUID. For example, the generated value might be *eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063*.
 2. Open the Azure Resource Manager template.
 3. Add a new resource in the main template file. The resource needs to be only in the *mainTemplate.json* or *azuredeploy.json* file, not in any nested or linked templates.
 4. Enter the GUID after the *pid-*, as shown previously.

    It should look something like this example:
   `pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063`

 5. Check the template for any errors.
 6. Republish the template in the appropriate repositories.

### Sample template code

```

{ // add this resource to the mainTemplate.json file (do not add the entire file)
      "apiVersion": "2018-02-01",
      "name": "pid-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX", // use your GUID here
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
      "properties": {
        "mode": "Incremental",
        "template": {
          "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
          "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
          "resources": []
        }
      }
    } // remove all comments from the file when done

```

## Method 2: Azure Resource Manager APIs

In some cases, to deploy Azure services, partners prefer to make calls directly against the Azure Resource Manager REST APIs. To enable this deployment, [Azure supports multiple SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=sdkstools). To deploy resources, you can use one of the SDKs or call the REST APIs directly.

If you are using an Azure Resource Manager template, tag your solution by using the instructions preceding. If you are not using an Azure Resource Manager template and making direct API calls, you can still tag your deployment to associate usage of Azure resources. 

### Tag a deployment by using the Azure Resource Manager APIs
For this approach, when you design your API calls, you include a GUID in the user agent header in the request. The GUID should be added for each offer or SKU. The string must be formatted with the prefix *pid-* and then include the partner-generated GUID.  

>[!NOTE] 
>Use this GUID format for insertion into the user agent: 
`pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063`. Replace this placeholder GUID with your GUID after the *pid-* (note hyphen).

The format of the string is important. If the prefix *pid-* is not included, we cannot query the data. SDKs do this in a variety of ways. To implement this method, review the support and approach for your preferred Azure SDK. 

### Example using the Python SDK
For Python, use the `config` attribute. You can add it only to a UserAgent, as shown here:

```python
client = azure.mgmt.servicebus.ServiceBusManagementClient(**parameters)
        client.config.add_user_agent("pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063")

```

Use this approach for each client. There is no global, static configuration. To ensure that every client is using it, you can choose to do a client factory. Get [Additional reference information](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/7402fb2c20be2cdbcaa7bdb2eeb72b7461fbcc30/src/azure-cli-core/azure/cli/core/commands/client_factory.py#L70-L79).

### Tag a deployment by using the Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI
If you deploy resources via Azure PowerShell, you can append your GUID by using the following method:

```
[Microsoft.Azure.Common.Authentication.AzureSession]::ClientFactory.AddUserAgent("pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063")

```

To append your GUID by using the Azure CLI, set the AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT environment variable. You can set the variable within the scope of a script or set it globally, for shell scope use:

```
export AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT='pid-eb7927c8-dd66-43e1-b0cf-c346a422063'

```

## Register GUIDs and offers

To include a GUID in your tracking, you must register it. You register all template GUIDs in the Azure Marketplace Cloud Partner portal. For access to the Cloud Partner portal, apply to the [Azure Marketplace](http://aka.ms/listonazuremarketplace).

Additional information about registering GUIDS:
*	Partners are required to [have a profile in the Cloud Partner portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/become-publisher) and are encouraged to list the offer in the Azure Marketplace or on AppSource. 
*	Partners can register multiple GUIDs. 
*	Partners can also register a GUID for non-Marketplace solution templates and offers.

After you've added the GUID to your template or in the user agent and you've registered the GUID in the Cloud Partner portal, Microsoft begins to track your deployments. 

## Verify GUID deployment 

After you've modified your template and performed a test deployment, you can retrieve the resources that were deployed and tagged by using the PowerShell script in this section. 

You can use the script to verify whether the GUID has been added to your Azure Resource Manager template successfully. This method does not apply to Azure Resource Manager API deployment.

Before you run the script, sign in to Azure and select the subscription that contains the deployment that you want to verify. It must be run within the subscription context of the deployment.

The GUID and `resourceGroup` name of the deployment are required parameters.

[Get the original script](https://gist.github.com/bmoore-msft/ae6b8226311014d6e7177c5127c7eba1#file-verify-deploymentguid-ps1).

```
Param(
    [GUID][Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]$guid,
    [string][Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]$resourceGroupName'
)

#get the correlationId of the pid deployment

$correlationId = (Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName 
$resourceGroupName -Name "pid-$guid").correlationId

#find all deployments with that correlationId

$deployments = Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName | Where-Object{$_.correlationId -eq $correlationId}

#find all deploymentOperations in a deployment by name (since PowerShell does not surface outputResources on the deployment or correlationId on the deploymentOperation)

foreach ($deployment in $deployments){

#get deploymentOperations by deploymentName and then the resourceId for any create operation

($deployment | Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeploymentOperation | Where-Object{$_.properties.provisioningOperation -eq "Create" -and $_.properties.targetResource.resourceType -ne "Microsoft.Resources/deployments"}).properties.targetResource.id

}

```

## Create a GUID

A GUID (globally unique identifier) is a 32-hexadecimal digit unique reference number. To create a GUID for tracking, use any of several online [GUID generators](https://www.bing.com/search?q=guid%20generator&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=2&pq=guid%20g&sc=8-6&sk=&cvid=0BAFAFCD70B34E4296BB97FBFA3E1B4E).

We encourage you to create a unique GUID for each offer and distribution channel. For example, if you have two solutions and both are deployed via a template and are available both in the Azure Marketplace and on GitHub, you should create 4 GUIDS:

*	Offer A in the Azure Marketplace 
*	Offer A on GitHub
*	Offer B in the Azure Marketplace 
*	Offer B on GitHub

Reporting is done by Microsoft Partner ID and GUID. 

You can also choose to track GUIDs at a more detailed level (that is, by SKU, where SKUs are variants of an offer).

## Guidance on privacy and data collection

You should provide messaging to inform your customers that deployments that include the Azure Resource Manager GUID tracking allow Microsoft to report to you the Azure usage that's associated with those deployments. Some example language follows. In addition, you should ensure that this messaging aligns with your own data privacy and collection policies, including options for your customers to be excluded from the tracking of the following types of deployments: 

* **Azure Resource Manager template deployments**

    When you deploy this template, Microsoft can identify the installation of our [insert partner software name] software with the Azure resources deployed. Microsoft can correlate the Azure resources used to support the software. Microsoft collects this information to provide the best experiences with their products and to operate their business. This data is collected and governed by Microsoft privacy policies, which you can find at the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter) site. 

* **For SDK or API deployments**

    When you deploy our software, Microsoft can identify the installation of our [insert partner software name] software with the Azure resources deployed. Microsoft can correlate the Azure resources used to support the software. Microsoft collects this information to provide the best experiences with their products and to operate their business. This data is collected and governed by Microsoft privacy policies, which you can find at the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter) site.

Microsoft provides partners a view of customer deployments of their templates and insights into their influenced usage. Both Microsoft and you can also use this information to drive both closer engagement between you and the Microsoft sales teams and a more consistent view of your impact on Azure growth. 

**Who can add a GUID to a template?**

The tracking resource is intended to connect your solution to your customers' Azure usage. The usage data is tied to your Microsoft Partner Network identity (MPN ID) and the reporting is made available to you in the Cloud Partner portal. 

**After a GUID has been added, can it be changed?**
 
Yes, a customer or an implementation partner can customize the template and could change or remove the GUID. We suggest that you proactively describe the role of the resource and GUID to your customers and other partners to prevent removal or edits to the tracking GUID. Note that changing the GUID affects only new deployments and resources, not existing deployments and resources.

**When will reporting be available?**

A beta version of reporting should be available soon. Reporting is integrated into the Cloud Partner portal.

**Can I track templates that are deployed from a non-Microsoft repository, such as GitHub?**

Yes. As long as the GUID is present when the template is deployed, the usage is tracked. 

To register related templates that are published outside of the Azure Marketplace, you are required to have a profile in the Cloud Partner portal. 

**Does it make a difference whether the template is deployed from Azure Marketplace or from other repositories, such as GitHub?**

Yes, partners who publish offers in the Azure Marketplace can receive more detailed data on deployments in the Azure Marketplace. You benefit from exposing your offers to customers in the Azure Marketplace portal and the Azure management portal. Offers in the Azure Marketplace also generate leads for you.

**What if I create a custom template for an individual customer engagement?**

You are still welcome to add the GUID to the template. If you use an existing, already registered GUID, it is included in the reporting. If you create a new GUID, you need to register it to get it included in tracking.

**Does the customer receive reporting as well?**

Customers are currently able to track their usage of individual resources or customer-defined resource groups within the Azure management portal.  

**Is this similar to the Digital Partner of Record (DPOR)?**

This new method of connecting the deployment and usage to a partnerâ€™s solution is intended to provide a mechanism to link a partner solution to Azure usage. DPOR is intended to associate a consulting (Systems Integrator) or management (Managed Service Provider) partner with a customerâ€™s Azure subscription.
