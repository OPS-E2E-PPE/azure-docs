# Power BI Apps prerequisites

This article lists the technical and business requirements that you must meet before you can publish a Power BI App offer to Microsoft AppSource Marketplace.

## Technical requirements

The primary technical asset you will need for this offer type is a [Power BI Application](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636). For more
information, see [Create Power BI technical assets](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md).

Once your service application is created and tested in Power BI, you should save the application installation URL that Power BI generates. You will need it to [create a new Power BI App offer](./cpp-create-offer.md).

## Business requirements

The business requirements include procedural, contractual, and legal obligations:

-   You must be a registered Cloud Marketplace Publisher. If you are not registered yet, follow the steps in the article [Become a Cloud Marketplace Publisher](../../become-publisher.md).

    > [!NOTE] 
    > You should use the same Microsoft Developer Center registration account to sign onto the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com). You should have only one Microsoft account for your AppSource offerings. It should not be specific to  individual services or offers.
 
-   You are responsible for making technical support available to customers in a commercially reasonable manner.
-   You must provide content that meets criteria for your offering to be listed on AppSource. For more information, see [Have an app to list on AppSource? Hereâ€™s how](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/have-an-app-to-list-on-appsource-here-s-how).
-   You must comply with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).


## Next steps

Once you have met all the requirements, you are ready to [create a Power BI offer](./cpp-create-offer.md) in the Cloud Partner Portal.
