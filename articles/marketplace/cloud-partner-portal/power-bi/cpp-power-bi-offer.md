# Power BI Application offer

|                  |                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| This section explains how to publish a Power BI Application to the Microsoft [AppSource Marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). A Power BI Application packages Power BI content and uses dataflows to connect reports and dashboards to data in common data storage. The app can be then deployed to other tenants through AppSource. | ![Power BI icon](./media/powerbi-icon.png) |

Power BI Apps publishing process

1. Create a service application in Power BI (which results in creating package installation URL).  This URL represents the technical assets for the offer.  For more information, see [What is Power BI](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).
2. Collect or create the business assets, including:
    - Marketing materials
    - Legal and support documents
3.  Create the offer â€“ Use the Cloud Partner Portal to configure the details and information about the offer, including the offer description, marketing materials, legal, support information, and asset specifications.
4.  Certify and publish the offer - This submission starts the publishing process.
    - The AppSource onboarding team tests, validates, and certifies your application. 
    - Once certified, you should review it on its test environment and release it.

Once all these steps are performed, your app will "go live" on AppSource.

## Next steps

Before you begin these steps, you must meet the [requirements](./cpp-prerequisites.md) for publishing a Power BI App to AppSource.
