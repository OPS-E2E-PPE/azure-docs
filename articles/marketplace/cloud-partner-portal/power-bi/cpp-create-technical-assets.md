# Create Power BI App technical assets

The primary technical asset you will need for this offer type is a Power BI Application, which is a collection of a primary dataset, report and (or) dashboard and optional connected services and embedded datasets. (Power BI applications are an evolution of asset type previously known as [content packs](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-organizational-content-pack-introduction).)  For complete information about developing these applications, see [Power BI Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).


## Obtaining an installation URL

Building Power BI App in only available within the [Power BI service](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) and requires sign in using a [Power BI Pro license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro). Once your service application is created and tested in Power BI, save the application installation URL that Power BI generates.  You must supply this URL in the [Technical Info tab](./cpp-technical-info-tab.md) of the Cloud Partner Portal submission form.
â€ƒ

## Next steps

After you have created and tested your Power BI App and created the associated offer, you can [publish the Power BI offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md).
