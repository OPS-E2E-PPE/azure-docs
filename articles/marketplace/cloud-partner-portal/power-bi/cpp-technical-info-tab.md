# Power BI Apps Technical Info tab

The **Technical Info** tab of the **New Offer** page is where you provide the Power BI installer package URL and any additional info required for the new
offerâ€™s validation.  For the initial release, all Power BI Apps are free, available for download from AppSource at no additional charge. As a result, you will not be able to define any stock keeping units (SKUs) for this offer type.

## Technical Info fields 

In the **Technical Info** tab, you must provide the following fields.  An appended asterisk (*) on the field label indicates that it is required.

|        Field          |  Description                                                                 |
|    ---------------    |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Installer URL**     | Address generated by Power BI when you publish the app and promote it to production.  For more information on how to generate the URL, see [Publish service apps in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-create-distribute-apps).  |
|  **Validation instructions**  |  Optional text instructions (max 3000 chars) for the Microsoft validation team to assist in configuring, connecting and testing your app, including: typical configuration settings, test accounts or parameters that can be used to test the "Connect Data" option, etc. This information will only be visible to the validation team and is only used for validation purposes.  |
| **Is this app created as a Power BI content pack?** | Currently, this is an internally used field. Leave the value set to its default value, `No`; otherwise, changing this field to `No` could impede publishing.  |

## Next steps

In the next [Storefront Details](./cpp-storefront-details-tab.md) tab, you will provide marketing and legal information for your app.
