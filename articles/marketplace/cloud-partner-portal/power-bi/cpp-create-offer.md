# Create a Power BI Application offer

This section lists the steps required to create a new Power BI App offer for [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). Every offer appears as its own entity in AppSource.  When you create a new offer in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/), you are required to supply four groups of assets for your offer.

|   Asset group      | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------   | ----------------                                                                    |
| Offer Settings     | Primary identifications and name for the offer                                      |
| Technical Info     | Installer URL used to install the app in clientâ€™s Power BI workspace. For more info on how to generate this URL, refer to [Power BI App documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).   |
| Storefront details | Contains marketing, legal and lead management assets. Marketing assets include offer description and logos.  Legal assets include a privacy policy, terms of use, and other legal documentation.  Lead management policy enables you to specify how to handle leads from the AppSource end-user portal. |
| Contacts           | Contains support contact and policy information                                     |
|    |     |
