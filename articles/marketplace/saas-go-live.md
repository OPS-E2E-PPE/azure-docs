# Publish a SaaS offer

After completing all tests on your preview, select **Go live** to publish your offer live to the commercial marketplace. If your offer is already live in the commercial marketplace, any updates you make won't go live until you select **Go live**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don’t ever select **Go live** for a [development/test offer](plan-saas-dev-test-offer.md) or an offer with a _test plan_.

Now that you’ve chosen to make your offer available in the commercial marketplace, we perform a series of final validation checks to ensure the live offer is configured just like the preview version of the offer. For details about these validation checks, see [Publish phase](review-publish-offer.md#publish-phase).

After these validation checks are complete, your offer will be live in the marketplace.
