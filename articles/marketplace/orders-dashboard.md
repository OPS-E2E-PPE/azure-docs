# Orders dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics

This article provides information on the Orders dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays information about your offer - subscriptions, orders, pricing model including growth trends, presented in a graphical and downloadable format.

>[!NOTE]
> For detailed definitions of analytics terminology, see [Commercial marketplace analytics terminology and common questions](./analytics-faq.yml).

## Orders dashboard

The [Orders dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165914) displays the current orders for all your offers, including software as a service (SaaS), with subscription-based billing model. You can view graphical representations of the following items:

- Subscription trend
- Subscription per seat and site trend
- Orders by offers
- Orders by geography
- Detailed orders table
- Orders page filters

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum latency between customer acquisition and reporting in Partner Center is 48 hours.

## Access the Orders dashboard

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
1. On the Home page, select the **Insights** tile.

    [ ![Illustrates the Insights tile on the Partner Center Home page.](./media/workspaces/partner-center-insights-tile.png) ](./media/workspaces/partner-center-insights-tile.png#lightbox)

1. In the left menu, select **Orders**.

## Elements of the Orders dashboard

The following sections describe how to use the Orders dashboard and how to read the data.

### Month range

You can find a month range selection at the top-right corner of each page. Customize the output of the **Orders** page graphs by selecting a month range based on the past 6 or 12 months, or by selecting a custom month range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default month range is six months.

[ ![Illustrates the month filters on the Orders dashboard.](./media/orders-dashboard/order-workspace-filters.png) ](./media/orders-dashboard/order-workspace-filters.png#lightbox)

### Public and Private offer
you can choose to view subscription and order details of public offers, private offers, or both by selecting the **Public offer** sub-tab, **Private offer** sub-tab, and the **All** sub-tab respectively.

[ ![Illustrates other filters on the Orders dashboard.](./media/orders-dashboard/offer-tabs.png) ](./media/orders-dashboard/offer-tabs.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> All metrics in the visualization widgets and export reports are as per the month range selected by the user.

### Subscription trend

In this section, you will find the **Subscription** chart that shows the trend of your active and canceled subscriptions for the selected month range. Metrics and growth trends are represented by a line chart and will display the value for each month by hovering over the line on the chart. The percentage value below the subscription metrics in the widget represents the amount of growth or decline during the selected month range.

There are two subscription counters: _Active_ and _Canceled_.

- **Active** equals the number of subscriptions that are currently in use by customers for the selected month range.
- **Canceled** equals the total number of subscriptions that were purchased but got canceled during the selected date range.

[![Illustrates the Orders widget on the Orders dashboard that shows the trend of active and canceled orders.](./media/orders-dashboard/orders-trend.png)](./media/orders-dashboard/orders-trend.png#lightbox)

### Subscription by per seat and site trend

The **Subscriptions by per seat and site-based** line chart represents the metric and trend of per-site (flat rate pricing) and per-seat (per user pricing) customer subscriptions for the selected month range.

Each monthly data point on the line graph represents the total count of seats or sites. The widget includes data for only active subscriptions in the selected month range.

**Tooltips:**

- Seats indicate seat count (asset quantity) of per user-based subscriptions
- Sites indicate site count (asset quantity) of flat rate based subscriptions
- Represents count and trend of change in total seats and site for the month range
- Growth % of these subscription seats and site count for the selected month range
- Month over month trend of these orders for the selected month range

[![Illustrates the Orders widget on the Orders dashboard that shows the orders per seat and site trend.](./media/orders-dashboard/seats-per-site.png)](./media/orders-dashboard/seats-per-site.png#lightbox)

Subscription offers can use one of two pricing models with each plan: either site-based (flat rate) or seat-based (per user).

- **Flat rate**: Enable access to your offer with a single monthly or annual flat rate price. This is sometimes referred to as site-based pricing.
- **Per user**: Enable access to your offer with a price based on the number of users who can access the offer or occupy seats. With this usage-based model, you can set the minimum and maximum number of users supported by the plan.<br>
You can create multiple plans to configure different price points based on the number of users. These fields are optional during creation of an offer in Partner center. If left unselected, the number of users will be interpreted as not having a limit (min of 1 and max of as many as your service can support). These fields can be edited as part of an update to your plan.
- **Metered Billing**: On top of Flat Rate pricing. With this pricing model, you can optionally define metered plans that use the marketplace metering service API to charge customers for usage that isn't covered by the flat rate. Higher the consumption of metered units may lead to higher charges for the customer.

For more details on seat, site, and metered-based billing, see [How to plan a SaaS offer for the commercial marketplace](plan-saas-offer.md).

### Orders by offers

The Orders by offers widget shows information about offers and SKU. This  chart shows the measures and trends of all offers. Orders are categorized under different statuses: New, Convert, Renewed, Canceled.

For different statuses, the _Orders_ sub-tab provides information about the count of orders, _Quantity_ sub-tab provides information about the number of seats added and/or removed by customers for existing subscription assets, and the _Revenue_ sub-tab provides information about the billed revenue of orders for the selected month range. Each order is categorized with one of below statuses:

- **New**: New orders purchased by customers for the selected month range.
- **Convert**: This indicates orders for which customers purchased an offer after its trial period was over
- **Renewed**: This indicates orders that were renewed for the selected month range. They do not include converted orders.
- **Cancelled**: Orders that were canceled during the selected month range. Revenue of canceled orders is calculated using billed revenue of last term before order cancellation.
- **Seats/Sites added**: Seats or Sites that were added by customers to existing subscription orders.
- **Seats/Sites removed**:  Seats or Sites that were removed by customers from existing subscription orders. Seats or sites removed due to orders cancellations are not taken into consideration.

**Additional information:**

- The top offers are displayed in the graph and the rest of the offers are grouped as *Rest All*.
- You can select specific offers in the legend to display only that offer and the associated SKUs in the graph.
- You can select any offer and a maximum of three SKUs of that offer to view the month-over-month trend for the offer, SKUs, and seats.
- Hovering over a slice in the graph displays the number of orders and percentage of that offer compared to your total number of orders across all offers.
- The **orders by offers trend** displays month-by-month growth trends. The month column represents the number of orders by offer name. The line chart displays the growth percentage trend plotted alongside the bar graphs.
