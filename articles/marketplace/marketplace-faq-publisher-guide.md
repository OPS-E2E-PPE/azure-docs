# Microsoft commercial marketplace publisher frequently asked questions

Answers to common questions about the commercial marketplace.

## General

### What is Microsoft commercial marketplace?

The commercial marketplace connects business and government agencies with solutions built by our partners. Our partners create and manage offers in Partner Center, and customers can discover and buy solutions through in-product experiences, such as Microsoft AppSource, Azure Marketplace, resellers in the Cloud Solution Provider program, and our sales teams via the co-sell program.

Learn more in the [Microsoft commercial marketplace hub](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/commercial-marketplace#/).

### What’s the difference between Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace?

AppSource includes business and industry solutions, such as apps that integrate into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform services.

Azure Marketplace includes IT and developer solutions that are built on Azure or used within Azure subscriptions themselves.

Learn more in the [buyer’s guide](https://aka.ms/MarketplaceBuyerGuide).

### Why should I make my software or services available in Microsoft commercial marketplace?

The commercial marketplace is a starting point for go-to-market collaboration and enablement with sales channels and Marketplace Rewards. The websites and in-product experiences give your products visibility to millions of our customers who are seeking solutions like yours. You don’t even need to build or buy the commerce capabilities. With availability in 141 regions (via a per plan basis). We manage tax payment in many countries, and provide access to our global channel network of resellers. You can use a customer’s Microsoft Customer Agreement or Enterprise Agreement to sell to organizations without creating a new buying relationship.

### Is there a listing fee for the Microsoft commercial marketplace?

No, there’s no cost to publish offers in our commercial marketplace. We keep a small percentage of the sale, as a transaction fee. This is invested in the Marketplace Rewards program, platform innovation, and commercial marketplace operations.

### How do I sign up to be a publisher in the Microsoft commercial marketplace?

To create offers in the commercial marketplace, your organization needs to be a Microsoft partner by agreeing to the Microsoft Partner Agreement and accepting the Publisher agreement.

[Sign up](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv) to be a commercial marketplace publisher.

### How can customers engage with offers in the commercial marketplace?

The way that your customers use your commercial marketplace offer depends on how you create the offer.

- For answers that are given automatically, whether they’re paid, bring your own license (BYOL), or free, the customer is urged to “Get It Now.”
- Offers that support a test drive (demo) request the customer to “Test Drive.” 
- Software as a Service (SaaS) offers that provide a trial outside our commercial marketplace, say “Free Trial.”
- Simple listings allow the customer to request “Contact Me.”

### How do I create offers for the commercial marketplace?

After you sign up and accept the Publisher Agreement, you’ll have access to the Commercial Marketplace page in Partner Center. This is where you create and manage offers, as well as view analytics reports. For Microsoft 365 apps, you must also activate the Office Store program within Partner Center.

For more information see [Welcome to the commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/) and [Monetize your Office 365 add-in through Microsoft Commercial Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/monetize-addins-through-microsoft-commercial-marketplace).

### How do I get support assistance for the commercial marketplace?

You can submit support tickets from within Partner Center to contact our marketplace publisher support team. We also have an active community where you can find best practices and information sharing.

[Submit a support ticket](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/v2/?stage=1) to the publisher support team, or join the [community forums](https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/Microsoft-AppSource-and-Azure/bd-p/2222).

### What analytics are available to my organization from the commercial marketplace?

We provide reporting on your offers within our commercial marketplace. Using Partner Center (under Analytics in the Commercial Marketplace area), you can access data on customers, orders, store engagement, and more.

Learn more at [Analytics for the commercial marketplace in Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/analytics).

### What is Microsoft’s relationship with my customers?

The commercial marketplace works using an agency model. The customer signs a purchase agreement with us, which uses their Microsoft Cloud Agreement (MCA) or Enterprise Agreement (EA). We’re responsible for billing, collections, tax payment in applicable regions, and publisher payout. As the publisher, you set the price, the terms of use, and provide technical support.

### What terms of use options are available with the commercial marketplace?

As a publisher, you set the terms of use for your software solution, which customers must accept as part of the purchase flow. To simplify and speed things up, we provide a Standard Contract (SC) that you can choose to include in your terms and conditions. This lets customers review the SC one time, get approval from legal and buying teams, and then focus on the amendments for each offer.

You can create changes that apply to all customers, or you can make them specific to certain customers of your choice. You can also fully customize your terms and conditions, which can be entered into a text box or hosted on a website, which will be shown as a web address.

Learn more at [Standard Contract for the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/standard-contract).

### Is Azure Marketplace available in Azure Government?

Yes, the Azure Government Marketplace is available within Azure Government regions and supports Azure Virtual Machine and Azure Application offers. There’s a checkbox option to make them available in the Azure Government Marketplace during the standard publishing process.

### What permissions do I need in Partner Center to manage my offers?

There are four relevant roles that govern Partner Center access.

- Manager: Provides permissions to manage Partner Center users in the directory, and create and update offers.
- Developer: Allows a user to create and update offers.
- Financial Contributor: Provides permissions to view payout reporting.
- Owner: Can set up the payout account and tax profile. The user who accepted the Publisher Agreement becomes the “Owner” by default.

Azure Active Directory (AAD) Global Admin permissions are necessary to create new user accounts or invite guest accounts in the underlying directory. Partner Center leverages AAD for the identity model, and an organization’s AAD instance is often managed and controlled by IT or security teams.

Learn more at [Assign users roles and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/permissions-overview).

### Do customers need a subscription for Microsoft Azure Cloud Services?

Depending on your product’s delivery model, a subscription to Azure Cloud Services may be needed. Solutions that are used directly in an Azure subscription, Microsoft 365 applications, or Dynamics 365 applications will require the customer has an existing subscription. Offers purchased in Azure Marketplace require an Azure subscription because it’s used as the billing mechanism

### Who’s responsible for supporting customers?

Commercial marketplace publishers are responsible for supporting their software, and we’re responsible for supporting the purchase, billing, payments, and subscription management experiences.

### What’s the process to validate the end to end purchase and provisioning flow?

During the publishing process, you’re given access to a preview of your offer. Access is restricted to users that you specify in the Preview tab, and this is an offer that can’t be seen by anyone else. You can purchase this and test the process; but you’ll be charged the full amount according to your offer's setup.

To complete a purchase at a very low price, we suggest publishing a private plan to yourself and at a price you can accept as the cost of testing. $0 is supported but will not reflect the full experience like a paid subscription, so we recommend $1.

### What are leads from the commercial marketplace and what should I do with them?

As customers use your offers on the Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace storefronts, information is captured. After they’ve demonstrated enough interest, a lead is created and opportunity sent to the system of your choice. Publishers who are successful with our commercial marketplace often pursue leads, develop relationships, and turn interest into deals.

Learn more at [Customer leads from your marketplace offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads).

### Why aren't my changes reflected in the offer on Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace?

Changes made within Partner Center are only updated in the system and marketplaces once you’ve republished the offer. Make sure that you’ve submitted the offer for publication after any changes.

## Channels

### Where can customers find my commercial marketplace offers?

Offers are presented to customers through in-product experiences, websites, resellers, and Microsoft sales teams based on how you’ve configured them and the context of the customers’ actions. If your software is used directly with Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, or the Power Platform service, customers can find it within the product. Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace are split by offer types and audiences, and resellers can only access your offer if you’ve opted-in to the Cloud Solution Provider program.

### Can my offer appear in both Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace?

Microsoft AppSource is the destination for business and industry solutions, and Azure Marketplace is designed for IT and developer solutions. Offers are available in each of the storefronts based on categories and industries selected during offer creation, and in the rare case that it is relevant to the users of both storefronts, it can appear in both.

### What is the Cloud Solution Provider program?

Our global network of resellers include tens of thousands of organizations who take part in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. The CSP program provides them with the ability to resell our products, offers from the commercial marketplace, and provides them with the tools to do it successfully.

Learn more at [Cloud Solution Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-solution-providers).

### How can I find resellers to establish partnerships?

Using the [solution provider directory](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home), you can search for our partners according to location, products, services, skills, industries, or organization name.

### Can I limit the resellers allowed to sell my offer?

Yes, you can set up offers to be available to all resellers in the Cloud Solution Provider program or to only those who you specify.

Learn more at [Cloud Solution Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-solution-providers).

### How can I pay margin to resellers?

The commercial marketplace doesn’t have the ability to specify margin for resellers or pay it to them directly and automatically. However, you can create agreements, sales contests, or margins outside the commercial marketplace systems.

### How does geographic availability work with resellers?

The availability of your offers and plans are defined by the customer’s billing location. So, a reseller will first select the customer they’re selling to and then select your offer. If the customer is in an unsupported location, your offer won’t be available to them.

## Billing capabilities

### What’s the difference between transaction and monetization?

- Transaction is the exchange of money for goods, and an offer is considered transactable in our commercial marketplace if it has a price and is paid by the customer through our billing and collections. 
- Monetization is the ability to charge money for your intellectual property (IP), which can happen within or outside our commerce platform. For example, your Bring Your Own License (BYOL) Teams app can be monetized with a transactable SaaS licensing service.

### What offer types are transacted through Microsoft?

Get It Now offers can be handled through Microsoft for some delivery models. This is currently supported with the following delivery models:

- VM Images
- Azure Apps (Managed App)
- SaaS

### What billing models are supported in the commercial marketplace?

- VM Images are billed based on hourly usage, and the price is set per hour.
- Managed Apps are billed with an optional monthly flat fee and any VM Images used by the app.
- SaaS apps are billed as a flat rate, per user, or custom meters on a monthly or annual basis.

### Can I monetize offer types that are not transactable?

Although not all offer types are transactable, you can still reach millions of customers, and monetize your IP. By adding a license check within your solution, you can collect payment for licenses. Selling licenses can be done through us or separately.

### Can I offer a software trial through the commercial marketplace?

Yes, and there are multiple ways to offer free trials:

- The preferred method is to add a free period at the beginning of paid SaaS offers (one month) and VM Image offers (one or three months). The customer will receive a $0 charge, and after the trial period ends, the subscription automatically changes to paid. The contract term then starts at that point.
- You can create a SaaS offer listing that takes the customer to a web address of your choice to start a trial outside of the commercial marketplace. Some offer types support a Test Drive that lets you provide the customer with a demo.

### Who pays for the underlying Azure consumption?

If the solution is used directly in a customer’s Azure subscription, they’re responsible for paying the Azure costs. If the solution is used in your Azure subscription, such as in the case of SaaS, you’re responsible for the Azure costs, and should account for that in the cost of the customer’s SaaS subscription.

### Can I sell professional services through the commercial marketplace?

Software that’s built-on or built-for our cloud services can be transacted through the commercial marketplace. Professional services are not yet transactable.

## Purchasing

### What’s required to purchase solutions from Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace?

Azure Marketplace requires the customer to have an Azure Active Directory ID and an active Azure subscription. If one or neither are in place, the user will be asked to create them in the purchase flow.

Microsoft AppSource requires that they have an Azure Active Directory ID. If one doesn’t exist, the user will be asked to create it in the purchase flow.

### What payment methods are supported with the commercial marketplace?

Microsoft AppSource supports credit card payments. Azure Marketplace supports credit card or invoicing. Offers purchased through Azure Marketplace are automatically added to the customer’s Azure bill and are charged according to the payment method associated with their subscription.

### Can customers apply Azure credits or sponsorship towards purchases?

No, prepaid or sponsored Azure spend can’t be used to buy partner solutions from Azure Marketplace.

### What Azure subscription permissions are required to complete a purchase?

### Can customers change subscriptions or license volumes mid-term?

Customers can increase or decrease user counts for per-user SaaS subscriptions at any time. The license subscription terms will remain the same regardless of any volume or plan upgrades. Plan changes are also supported for existing subscriptions via the application programming interfaces (API). Publishers can use API calls to change the customer’s subscription plan. We encourage independent software vendors (ISVs) to consider a customer’s user experience within the SaaS solution for upgrade and downgrade situations.

If the plan is changed for an existing subscription, the term remains unchanged, and the cost is prorated according to the duration of the remaining term.

### What could block a customer from completing a purchase?

For Microsoft AppSource, the customer must have a credit card with a billing address in the same country as their Azure Active Directory (AAD) instance, and the customer’s AAD admin must ensure the system doesn’t prevent authentication to Microsoft AppSource.

For Azure Marketplace, the customer must have an active Azure subscription and a user account with Owner or Contributor permissions on that subscription. The customer’s Azure admin must make sure the Azure Policy doesn’t conflict with the offer being used, and to ensure that Cost Management can’t be set up to disable Azure Marketplace.

## Collection and payouts

### When are customers billed for their purchases in the commercial marketplace?

Customers are usually billed monthly for any purchases in the previous billing cycle. Consumption based offers like VM Images or SaaS with metered billing plans are charged after they’ve been used. Subscription based plans are charged at the beginning of the term.

### How often will I receive payouts for sales through the commercial marketplace?

Payouts happen monthly. Collections processed in the previous month are paid out at once, and a must have a minimum combined value of $50.

Credit card subscriptions and purchases are billed monthly, and invoices against a Microsoft Customer Agreement or Enterprise Agreement may be less frequent. From the time of billing the customer, we give the customer 30 days to pay. After we receive the payment from the customer, credit card transactions go into a 30-day escrow period.
