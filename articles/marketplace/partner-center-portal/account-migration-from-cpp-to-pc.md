# Account migration from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center

If you have an existing CPP account, your account settings need to be migrated to Partner Center.

## Account migration process

If you are a user with the Owner role in CPP for a given account, a yellow banner is shown on your Publisher Profile page. You may belong to one of the following two cases:

- Your account has already been migrated, and you are ready to manage your Account Settings in Partner Center.
- You need to take some further actions to complete your account migration to Partner Center.

### Your account has been migrated to Partner Center

For all accounts that have completed migration from the CPP to Partner Center, account management will happen in Partner Center. Changes such as user addition/deletion will be synced back to CPP.

### You have not yet migrated your account to Partner Center

Click on the banner to initiate your account migration process. You are expected to enter the following items:

1. Work email address: <br> <br> In most cases, sign in with the email address that you use to sign into CPP. In certain cases, a different email address must be used:

    * Microsoft account: If the CPP account is a Microsoft account, then you need to enter a valid work email address associated with the tenant, for whom the MPN ID is registered.

    * Tenant mismatch: If your work email address does not belong to the tenant that is associated with the Microsoft Partner Network ID present on your CPP account, then youâ€™ll see an error. To move past this error, enter an email address associated with the tenant. An error message will provide the name of the tenant.

2. Sign up for Microsoft Partner Network program

    In the event that your CPP account does not have a Microsoft Partner Network ID, or has one that is invalid, you will have to sign up for the Microsoft Partner Network program as part of the activation process.
