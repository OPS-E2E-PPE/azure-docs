# Azure Marketplace consulting services
With a goal of connecting customers with services to support and extend their use of Azure, the Azure Marketplace supports the listing of consulting-service offerings from System Integrator (SI) partners of Microsoft. 

These consulting-service offerings are customer-specific engagements. They're fixed in scope and duration, can be fixed-price or free, and have a defined outcome. Potential customers can easily request to be contacted by partners. Partners receive a notification in their CRM system, and they aim to respond to requests within 48 hours.

Service offers that are based on Microsoft Dynamics 365, Office 365, and Power BI are eligible to be listed on AppSource. For more information, see [Microsoft AppSource consulting services listing guidelines](https://smp-cdn-prod.azureedge.net/documents/Microsoft%20AppSource%20Partner%20Listing%20Guidelines.pdf). 

## Eligible services and partners

Partners are also required to have a silver or gold competency in the relevant area for their service. The eligible competencies are listed in the following table:

|Competency  |Solution area  |
|---------|---------|
|Cloud Platform and Infrastructure     |   Cloud Platform, Data Center      |
|Application Development and ISV     |  Application Development, Application Integration, DevOps       |
|Data Management and Analytics    |  Data Analytics, Data Platform       |

Offerings must be of one of the following five service types (you can list more than one): 

* **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer’s environment to determine the applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of cost and timing. 
* **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a consulting service to draw customer interest by using frameworks, demos, and customer examples. 
* **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution. We recommend limiting it to solutions that can be implemented in two weeks or less. 
* **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets customer requirements. 
* **Workshop**: An interactive engagement that's conducted on a customer’s premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos that are built on the customer’s data or environment. 

Except for the *Briefing* service type, consulting services can be offered in-person (that is, onsite at a customer’s location or a partner’s facility) or virtually (that is, via teleconferencing, web conferencing, or remote implementation). Briefings must be offered in person.

For more information, see [competencies through Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/membership/competencies). 

## Supported countries

SI partners can submit consulting-service offerings for the following 18 countries. 

|Eligible countries |  |  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Australia    |Germany         |New Zealand         |
|Belgium     |Italy         |Norway         |
|Canada     |India         |Poland         |
|Denmark     |Japan         |Sweden         |
|Finland     |Mexico         |United Kingdom         |
|France     |Netherlands         |United States         |

The launch of Azure Marketplace consulting services will go live first for Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The catalogs for other countries will go live after a meaningful number and compelling selection of service offerings have been submitted by partners and approved by Microsoft.

## Prepare your publishing artifacts
Even before you nominate your service, you can start collecting and preparing the content that will help your listing articulate the value of your service and solution to your target customer. 

|Set up for new publishers  |
|---------|
|MPN ID     |
|Company logos (48 &#215; 48, 216 &#215; 216)     |
|Lead Destination     |


|Set up for new offers  |
|---------|
|Offer name (200 characters) and description (2000 characters)    |
|Competencies     |
|Country/region availability     |
|Duration of engagement     |
|Applicable industries, categories, and search keywords     |
|Product overview video    |
|Screenshots (maximum of 5, 1280 &#215; 720)     |
|Marketing documents (maximum of 3)     |


## Publishing process
Listing your consulting-service offer on the Azure Marketplace involves the following stages:

1. **Request**: To send your request, use the [Azure Marketplace Nomination Form](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/sell/nominate) and tell us more about your organization. 
2. **Validation**: Your request is reviewed to ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria. We then send you instructions for listing your consulting services offering. 
3. **Submit**: Provide the required information that's listed in the instructions. All content and supporting material must be submitted in English. 
4. **Review**: Our marketing and editorial team reviews your submission and optimizes it for readability, grammar, and effectiveness. 
5. **Staging**: Your submission is staged for your review. 
6. **Publishing**: When you and Microsoft are satisfied with the staged content, your listing is ready to go live on the Azure Marketplace. The go-live date for your listing depends on the country that's specified in your offering. If the catalog for your selected country is already live on the Azure Marketplace, your listing will appear within a few hours. Otherwise, the listing will appear as soon as the catalog goes live.
