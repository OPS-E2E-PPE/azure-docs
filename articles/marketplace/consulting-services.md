# Azure Marketplace Consulting Services
With the goal of connecting customers with services to support and extend their use of Microsoft Azure, Azure Marketplace supports the listing of consulting services offerings from System Integrator (SI) partners of Microsoft. 

These consulting services offerings are customer-specific engagements, fixed in scope and duration, can be fixed price or free, and have a defined outcome. Potential customers can easily request to be contacted by partners in a friction-free manner. Partners receive a notification in their CRM system and aim to respond to users within 48hrs.

Service Offers  based on Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft Office 365, and Microsoft Power BI are eligible to be listed on AppSource. Review detailed [guidelines for these services here](https://smp-cdn-prod.azureedge.net/documents/Microsoft%20AppSource%20Partner%20Listing%20Guidelines.pdf). 

## Eligible services and partners

Partners are also required to have a silver or gold competency in the relevant area for their service. See below for eligible Competencies:

|Competency  |Solution Area  |
|---------|---------|
|Cloud Platform and Infrastructure     |   Cloud Platform, Data Center      |
|Application Development and ISV     |  Application Development, Application Integration, DevOps       |
|Data Management and Analytics    |  Data Analytics, Data Platform       |

Offerings must be of one of the following five service types. Please note that you can list more than one offer: 

1. **Assessment:** An evaluation of a customer’s environment to determine the applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of cost and timing. 
2. Briefing: An introduction to a solution or a consulting service to draw customer interest using frameworks, demos, and customer examples. 
3. **Implementation:** A complete installation that results in a fully working solution. We recommend limiting to solutions that can be implemented in 2 weeks or less. 
4. **Proof of concept:**A limited scope implementation to determine if a solution will meet a customer’s requirements. 
5. **Workshop:** An interactive engagement conducted on a customer’s premises that could involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos built on the customer’s data or environment. 

Except for Briefings, consulting services may be offered in-person (i.e., onsite at a customer’s location or a partner’s facility) or virtually (i.e., via teleconferencing, web conferencing, remote implementation, etc.). Briefings must be offered in person.

## Countries supported

SI partners can submit consulting services offerings for the following 18 countries. 


|Eligible Countries |  |  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Australia    |Germany         |New Zealand         |

|Finland     |Mexico         |United Kingdom         |

The catalogs for other countries will go live once a meaningful number and compelling selection of services offerings have been submitted by partners and approved by Microsoft.

## Publishing process
Listing your consulting service offer on Azure Marketplace involves the following:

1. **Request:** Send in your request [here](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/sell/nominate)  and tell us more about your organization. 
2. **Validation:**Your request will be reviewed to validate that you meet the eligibility criteria. We will then send you instructions for listing your consulting services offering. 
3. **Submit:** Provide the information required in the instructions. All content and supporting material need to be submitted in English. 
4. **Review:** Our marketing and editorial team will review your submission and make changes to optimize it for readability, grammar, and effectiveness. 
5. **Staging:** Your submission will then be staged for review by you. 
6. **Publishing:** Once you and Microsoft are satisfied with the staged content, your listing is ready to go live on Azure Marketplace. The go-live date for your listing will depend on the country specified in your offering. If the catalog for your selected country is already live on Azure Marketplace, your listing will appear within a few hours. Otherwise, your listing will appear as soon as the catalog for your selected country goes live.
