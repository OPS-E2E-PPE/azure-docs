# Azure Container Registry integration with Security Center (Preview)

Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed, private Docker registry service that stores and manages your container images for Azure deployments in a central registry. It's based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0.

For deeper visibility into your registry and images' vulnerabilities, users of Azure Security Center's standard tier can enable the optional Container Registries bundle (for an additional cost). For more information, see [pricing](security-center-pricing.md).

This is a sample recommendation regarding vulnerabilities discovered in an image:

## Benefits of integration

Security Center identifies ACR registries in your subscription and seamlessly provides:

* **Azure-native vulnerability scanning** for all pushed Linux images. Security Center scans the image using a scanner from the industry-leading vulnerability scanning vendor, Qualys. This native solution is seamlessly integrated by default.

* **Security recommendations** for Linux images with known vulnerabilities. Security Center provides details of each reported vulnerability and a  severity classification. Additionally, it gives guidance for how to  remediate the specific vulnerabilities found on each image pushed to registry.
