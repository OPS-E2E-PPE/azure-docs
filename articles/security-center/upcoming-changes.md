### Two recommendations from "Apply system updates" security control being deprecated

**Estimated date for change:** June 2021

The following two recommendations are being deprecated:

- **OS version should be updated for your cloud service roles** - By default, Azure periodically updates your guest OS to the latest supported image within the OS family that you've specified in your service configuration (.cscfg), such as Windows Server 2016.
- **Kubernetes Services should be upgraded to a non-vulnerable Kubernetes version** - This recommendation's evaluations aren't as wide-ranging as we'd like them to be. The current version of this recommendation will eventually be replaced with an enhanced version that's better aligned with our customer's security needs.


### Legacy implementation of ISO 27001 is being replaced with new ISO 27001:2013

The legacy implementation of ISO 27001 will be removed from Security Center's regulatory compliance dashboard. If you're tracking your ISO 27001 compliance with Security Center, onboard the new ISO 27001:2013 standard for all relevant management groups or subscriptions, and the current legacy ISO 27001 will soon be removed from the dashboard.

### Recommendations to encrypt with customer-managed keys (CMKs) being disabled

**Estimated date for change:** June 2021

Security Center includes multiple recommendations to encrypt data at rest with customer-managed keys, such as:

- Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)
- Azure Cosmos DB accounts should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest
- Azure Machine Learning workspaces should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)

Data in Azure is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when required for compliance with a specific policy your organization is choosing to enforce.

With this change, the recommendations to use CMKs will be **disabled by default**. When relevant for your organization, you can enable them by changing the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding security policy to **AuditIfNotExists** or **Enforce**. Learn more in [Enable a security policy](tutorial-security-policy.md#enable-a-security-policy).

Initially, this change will be reflected in the names of the recommendation with a new prefix, **[Enable if required]**, as shown in the following examples:

- [Enable if required] Storage accounts should use customer-managed key to encrypt data at rest
- [Enable if required] Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)
- [Enable if required] Azure Cosmos DB accounts should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest

### Enhancements to SQL data classification recommendation

**Estimated date for change:** Q3 2021

The recommendation **Sensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified** in the **Apply data classification** security control will be replaced with a new version that's better aligned with Microsoft's data classification strategy. As a result the recommendation's ID will also change (currently, it's b0df6f56-862d-4730-8597-38c0fd4ebd59).

### Enable Azure Defender security control to be included in secure score

**Estimated date for change:** Q3 2021

Security Center's hardening recommendations are grouped into security controls. Each control is a logical group of related security recommendations, and reflects a vulnerable attack surface. The contribution of each security control towards the overall secure score is shown clearly on the recommendations page as well as in the list of controls in [Security controls and their recommendations](secure-score-security-controls.md#security-controls-and-their-recommendations).

Since its introduction, the **Enable Azure Defender** control has had a maximum possible score of 0 points. **With this change, the control will contribute towards your secure score**.

When you enable Azure Defender you'll extend the capabilities of Security Center's free mode to your workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads. Some of the major features of Azure Defender are: integrated Microsoft Defender for Endpoint licenses for your servers, vulnerability scanning for virtual machines and container registries, security alerts based on advanced behavioral analytics and machine learning, and container security features. For a full list, see [Azure Security Center free vs Azure Defender enabled](security-center-pricing.md).

With this change, there will be an impact on the secure score of any subscriptions that aren't protected by Azure Defender. We suggest you enable Azure Defender before this change occurs to ensure there is no impact on your scores.
