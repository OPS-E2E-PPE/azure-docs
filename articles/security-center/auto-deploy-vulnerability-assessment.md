# Automatically configure vulnerability assessment for your machines

Security Center collects data from your machines using agents and extensions. Those agents and extensions *can* be installed manually (see [Manual installation of the Log Analytics agent](security-center-enable-data-collection.md#manual-agent)). However, **auto provisioning** reduces management overhead by installing all required agents and extensions on existing - and new - machines to ensure faster security coverage for all supported resources. Learn more in [Configure auto provisioning for agents and extensions from Azure Security Center](security-center-enable-data-collection.md).

To assess your machines for vulnerabilities, you can use one of the following solutions:

- Microsoft's threat and vulnerability management module of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (included with Azure Defender for servers)
- An integrated Qualys agent (included with Azure Defender for servers)
- A Qualys or Rapid7 scanner which you have licensed separately and configured within Security Center (this is called the Bring Your Own License, or BYOL, scenario)

> [!NOTE]
> To automatically configure a BYOL solution, see [Integrate security solutions in Azure Security Center](security-center-partner-integration.md).

## Automatically enable a vulnerability assessment solution

1. From Security Center's menu, select **Pricing & settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. Open the **Auto provisioning** page.
1. Set the status of auto provisioning for the vulnerability assessment for machines to **On** and select the relevant solution.

    > [!TIP]
    > Security Center enables the following policy: [(Preview) Configure machines to receive a vulnerability assessment provider](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f13ce0167-8ca6-4048-8e6b-f996402e3c1b).

1. Select **Apply** and **Save**.

1. To view the findings for **all** supported vulnerability assessment solutions, see the **Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated.** recommendation.
