# Investigate weaknesses with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's threat and vulnerability management 

[Microsoft's threat and vulnerability management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) is a built-in module in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint that can:

- Discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization

If you've enabled the [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](security-center-wdatp.md), you'll automatically get the threat and vulnerability management findings without the need for additional agents.

As it's a built-in module for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, **threat and vulnerability management** doesn't require periodic scans.

For a quick overview of threat and vulnerability management, watch this video:

> [!TIP]
> As well as alerting you to vulnerabilities, threat and vulnerability management provides additional functionality for Security Center's asset inventory tool. Learn more in [Software inventory](asset-inventory.md#access-a-software-inventory).

## Onboarding your machines to threat and vulnerability management

The integration with Azure Defender doesn't involve any changes at the endpoint level: it takes place in the background between the two platforms. 

- **To manually onboard one or more machines** to threat and vulnerability management, use the security recommendation "[A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ffff0522-1e88-47fc-8382-2a80ba848f5d)":

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-tvm/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-solutions.png" alt-text="Selecting a volnerability assessment solution from the recommendation":::

- **To automatically surface the vulnerabilities**, on existing and new machines, without the need to manually remediate the recommendation mentioned above, see [Automatically configure vulnerability assessment for your machines](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md).

- **To onboard via the REST API**, run PUT/DELETE using this URL: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/.../providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/mdetvm?api-version=2015-06-01-preview`


The findings for **all** vulnerability assessment tools are provided in a Security Center recommendation **Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated.**.

Security Center also offers vulnerability analysis for your:

- SQL databases - see [Explore vulnerability assessment reports in the vulnerability assessment dashboard](defender-for-sql-on-machines-vulnerability-assessment.md#explore-vulnerability-assessment-reports)
- Azure Container Registry images - see [Use Azure Defender for container registries to scan your images for vulnerabilities](defender-for-container-registries-usage.md)
