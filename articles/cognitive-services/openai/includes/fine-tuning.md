> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deployed customized models (fine-tuned models) that are inactive for greater than 90 days will automatically have their deployments deleted. **The underlying fine-tuned model is retained and can be redeployed at any time**. Once a fine-tuned model is deployed, it will continue to incur an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether you're actively using the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI, refer to our [cost management guide](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/manage-costs#base-series-and-codex-series-fine-tuned-models).
