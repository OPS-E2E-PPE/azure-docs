# Migrate Hub workspace and projects to Custom Translator

You can migrate your [Microsoft Translator Hub](https://hub.microsofttranslator.com/) workspace and projects to Custom Translator. Migration starts from Hub.


These items are migrated during the process:

1.	The Project(s) definitions.

2.	The training definition will be used to create a new model definition on Custom Translator.

3.	The parallel and monolingual files used within the trainings will all be migrated as new Documents in Custom Translator.

4.	The autogenerated system test and tuning data will be exported and created as new Documents in Custom Translator.

For all deployed trainings, Custom Translator will train the model without any cost. You have the option manually deploy them.

>[!Note]
>For a training to succeed, Custom Translator requires minimum 10,000 extracted sentences. For less number of extracted sentences than the [suggested minimum](sentence-alignment.md#suggested-minimum-number-of-extracted-and-aligned-sentences), Custom Translator can't conduct a training.

For all successful trainings, which are not deployed, they will be migrated as draft in Custom Translator.

## Find Custom Translator Workspace Id

To migrate [Microsoft Translator Hub](https://hub.microsofttranslator.com/) workspace you need destination Workspace Id in Custom Translator. The destination workspace in Custom Translator is where all your Hub workspaces and projects shall be migrated to.

You will find your destination Workspace Id on Custom Translator Settings page: 

1.	Go to "Setting" page in the Custom Translator portal.

2.	You will find the Workspace Id in the Basic Information section.
