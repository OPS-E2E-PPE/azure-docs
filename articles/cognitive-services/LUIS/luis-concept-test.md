# Testing in LUIS

Testing is the process of providing sample utterances to LUIS and getting a response of LUIS-recognized intents and entities. 

You can [test](Train-Test.md) LUIS interactively, one utterance at a time, or provide a batch of utterances. In the interactive test, you can compare the current active model to the published model. 

<a name="A-test-score"></a>
<a name="Score-all-intents"></a>
<a name="E-(exponent)-notation"></a>
## What is a score in testing?
See [Prediction score](luis-concept-prediction-score.md) concepts to learn more about prediction scores.

## Interactive testing
Interactive testing is done from the **Test panel** of the website. You can quickly enter utterances to see how intents and entities are identified and scored. If LUIS isn't predicting the intents and entities as you expect on an utterance in the testing pane, copy it to the Intent page as a new utterance. Then label the parts of that utterance, and train LUIS. 

## Batch testing
[Batch testing](train-test.md#batch-testing) allows LUIS to test up to 10 sets of 1,000 utterances and score the batch in a graphical manner so you can see the results as a group. The results can be broken up in to intents, entities, and you can select individual points on the graph to review the utterance information.

It is important that utterances used for batch testing are new to LUIS. If you have a dataset of utterances, divide the utterances into three sets: utterances add to the model, utterances received from the published endpoint, and utterances used to batch test LUIS after it is trained. 

If there are errors in the batch testing, you can either add more labels to help LUIS make the discrimination between intents or add a [phrase list](luis-concept-feature.md) feature with domain-specific vocabulary to help LUIS learn faster. 

## Endpoint testing
You can test using the [endpoint](luis-glossary.md#endpoint) with a maximum of two versions of your app. With your main or live version of your app set as the production endpoint, add a second version to the staging endpoint. This approach gives you three versions of an utterance: the current model in the Test pane of the LUIS website, and the two versions at the two different endpoints. 

All endpoint testing counts against your usage quota. 

## Do not log tests
If you test against an endpoint, and do not want the utterance logged, remember to use the `logging=false` query string configuration.

## Where to find utterances
LUIS stores all logged utterances in the query log, available for download on the LUIS website applications list page, as well as the LUIS authoring APIs. 

Any utterances LUIS is unsure of are listed in the **[Review endpoint utterances](label-suggested-utterances.md)** page of the LUIS website.

## Remember to train
Remember to train LUIS after you make changes to the model. Changes to the LUIS app are not seen in testing until the app is trained. 

## Best practice - test at the endpoint
Developers should start testing their LUIS application with real traffic by sending utterances to the endpoint. These utterances are used to improve the performance of the intents and entities with [Review utterances](label-suggested-utterances.md). 

## Best practice - three sets of data
Developers should have three sets of test data. The first is for building the model, the second is for testing the model at the endpoint. The third is used in [batch testing](train-test.md#batch-testing). The first set is not used in training the application nor sent on the endpoint.
