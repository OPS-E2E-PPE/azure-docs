* Retest the batch

## Prerequisites

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * For this article, you also need a [LUIS][LUIS] account in order to author your LUIS application.

> [!Tip]
> If you do not already have a subscription, you can register for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Create new app
This article uses the prebuilt domain HomeAutomation. The prebuilt domain has intents, entities, and utterances for controlling HomeAutomation devices such as lights. Create the app, add the domain, train, and publish.

1. In the [LUIS] website, create a new app by selecting **Create new app** on the **MyApps** page. 

    ![Create new app](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/create-app-1.png)

2. Enter the name `Batchtest-HomeAutomation` in the dialog.

    ![Enter app name](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/create-app-2.png)

3. Select **Prebuilt Domains** in bottom left corner. 

    ![Select Prebuilt Domain](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/prebuilt-domain-1.png)

4. Select **Add Domain** for HomeAutomation.

    ![Add HomeAutomation domain](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/prebuilt-domain-2.png)

5. Select **Train** in the top right navigation bar.

    ![Select Train button](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/train-button.png)

6. Select **Publish** in the top right navigation bar.

7. Select **Publish to production slot**. 

    ![Publish the app](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/publish.png)

## Batch test criteria
Batch testing can test up to 1000 utterances at a time. The batch should not have duplicates. [Export](create-new-app.md#export-app) the app in order to see the list of current utterances.  

The test strategy for LUIS uses three separate sets of data: model utterances, batch test utterances, and endpoint utterances. For this tutorial, make sure you are not using the utterances from either model utterances (added to an intent), or endpoint utterances. 

Do not use any of the utterances already in the app for the batch test:

```
'breezeway on please',
'change temperature to seventy two degrees',
'coffee bar on please',
'decrease temperature for me please',
'dim kitchen lights to 25 .',
'fish pond off please',
'fish pond on please',
'illuminate please',
'living room lamp on please',
'living room lamps off please',
'lock the doors for me please',
'lower your volume',
'make camera 1 off please',
'make some coffee',
'play dvd',
'set lights bright',
'set lights concentrate',
'set lights out bedroom',
'shut down my work computer',
'silence the phone',
'snap switch fan fifty percent',
'start master bedroom light .',
'theater on please',
'turn dimmer off',
'turn off ac please',
'turn off foyer lights',
'turn off living room light',
'turn off staircase',
'turn off venice lamp',
'turn on bathroom heater',
'turn on external speaker',
'turn on my bedroom lights .',
'turn on the furnace room lights',
'turn on the internet in my bedroom please',
'turn on thermostat please',
'turn the fan to high',
'turn thermostat on 70 .' 
```

## Create a batch to test intent prediction accuracy
1. Create `homeauto-batch-1.json` in a text editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

2. Add utterances with the **Intent** you want predicted in the test. For this tutorial, to make it simple, take utterances in the `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` and `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` and switch the `on` and `off` text in the utterances. For the `None` intent, add a couple of utterances that are not part of the [domain](luis-glossary.md#domain) (subject) area. 

    In order to understand how the batch test results correlate to the batch JSON, add only six intents.

    ```JSON
    [
        {
          "text": "lobby on please",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "change temperature to seventy one degrees",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "where is my pizza",
          "intent": "None",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "call Jack at work",
          "intent": "None",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "breezeway off please",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "coffee bar off please",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
          "entities": []
        }
    ]
    ```

## Run the batch
1. Select **Test** in the top navigation bar. 

    ![Select Test in navigation bar](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/test-1.png)

2. Select **Batch testing panel** in the right-side panel. 

    ![Select Batch test panel](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/test-2.png)

3. Select **Import dataset**.

    ![Select Import dataset](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/test-3.png)

4. Choose the file system location of the `homeauto-batch-1.json` file.

5. Name the dataset `set 1`.

    ![Select file](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/test-4.png)

6. Select the **Run** button. Wait until the test is done.

    ![Select Run](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/test-5.png)

7. Select **See results**.

    ![See results](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/test-6.png)

8. Review results in the graph and legend.

    ![Batch results](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/batch-result-1.png)

## Review batch results
The batch results are in two sections. The top section contains the graph and the legend. The bottom section displays utterances when you select an area name of the graph.

Any errors are indicated by the color red. The graph is in four sections, with two of the sections displayed in red. **These are the sections to focus on**. 

The top right section indicates the test incorrectly predicted the existence of an intent or entity. The bottom left section indicates the test incorrectly predicted the absence of an intent or entity.

### HomeAutomation.TurnOff test results
In the legend, select the `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` intent. It has a green success icon to the left of the name in the legend. There are no errors for this intent. 

![Batch results](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/batch-result-1.png)

### HomeAutomation.TurnOn and None intents have errors
The other two intents have errors, meaning the batch test predictions didn't match the batch file expectations. Select the `None` intent in the legend. 

![None intent](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/none-intent-failures.png)

The two intents (dots on the chart) in the left bottom panel, in red, are the failures. Select **False Negative** in the chart to see the failed utterances. 

![False negative failures](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/none-intent-false-negative.png)

The two failing utterances should have been labeled as `None` intent but were instead labeled `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` intent. Because of this failure, both intents'
expectations (HomeAutomation.TurnOn and None) failed.

To determine why the `None` utterances are failing, review the utterances currently in `None`:

```
"decrease temperature for me please"
"dim kitchen lights to 25."
"lower your volume"
"turn on the internet in my bedroom please"
```

These utterances are supposed to be outside the app domain but are not. To fix the app, the utterances currently in the `None` intent need to be moved into the correct intent and the `None` intent needs new, appropriate intents. 

Three of the utterances in the `None` intent are meant to lower the automation device settings. They use words such as `dim`, `lower`, or `decrease`. The fourth utterance asks to turn on the internet. Since all four utterances are about turning on or changing the degree of power to a device, they should be moved to the `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` intent. 

This is just one solution. You could also create a new intent of `ChangeSetting` and move the utterances using dim, lower, and decrease into that new intent. 

## Fix the app based on batch results
Move the four utterances to the `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` intent. 

1. To fix the app so the batch is successful, exit the batch test panel by selecting **Test** in the top navigation panel. 

2. Select **Intents** in the left navigation panel. 

3. Select the `None` intent.  

4. Select the checkbox above the utterance list so all utterances are selected. 

5. In the **Reassign intent** drop-down, select `HomeAutomation.TurnOn`. 

    ![Move utterances](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/move-utterances.png)

    After the four utterances are reassigned, the utterance list for the `None` intent is empty.

6. Add four new intents for the None intent:

    ```
    "When is the game?"
    "Call Mom about the party."
    "The recipe calls for more milk."
    "The pizza is done."
    ```

    These utterances are definitely outside the domain of HomeAutomation. 

7. Because none of these utterances should have a HomeAutomation.Device ("light", "camera"), HomeAutomation.Operation("on","off") or HomeAutomation.Room ("living room"), remove any labels by selecting the blue label in the utterance and select **Remove label**.

8. Select **Train** in the top right navigation bar.

9. Select **Publish** in the top right navigation bar. 

## Verify the fix
In order to verify that the utterances in the batch test are correctly predicted for the **None** intent, run the batch test again.

1. Select **Test** in the top navigation bar. 

2. Select **Batch testing panel** in the right-side panel. 

3. Select the three dots (...) to the right of the batch name and select **Run Dataset**. Wait until the batch test is done.

    ![Run dataset](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/run-dataset.png)

4. Select **See results**. The intents should all have green icons to the left of the intent names. Select the green dot in the top right panel closest to the middle of the chart. The name of the utterance appears in the table below the chart. The score of `breezeway off please` is very low at 0.24. An optional activity is to add more utterances to the intent to increase this score. 

    ![Run dataset](./media/luis-tutorial-batch-testing/turnoff-low-score.png)

<!-- WAITING ON FIX

The Entities section of the legend may have errors. That is the next thing to fix.

## Create a batch testing with entities
1. Create `homeauto-batch-2.json` in a text editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The [file]() is also available in the LUIS-Samples repository. 

2. Add utterances to the file with entities. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "text": "lobby on please",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Room",
        "startPos": 0,
        "endPos": 4
      },
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Operation",
        "startPos": 6,
        "endPos": 7
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "text": "change temperature to seventy one degrees",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Device",
        "startPos": 7,
        "endPos": 17
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "text": "where is my pizza",
    "intent": "None",
    "entities": []
  },
  {
    "text": "call Jack at work",
    "intent": "None",
    "entities": []
  },
  {
    "text": "breezeway off please",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Room",
        "startPos": 0,
        "endPos": 8
      },
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Operation",
        "startPos": 10,
        "endPos": 12
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "text": "coffee bar off please",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Room",
        "startPos": 0,
        "endPos": 9
      },
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Operation",
        "startPos": 11,
        "endPos": 13
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
