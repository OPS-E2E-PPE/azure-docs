# Speech Service release notes

See below for information about changes to Speech services and resources.

## What's new?

* Speech SDK 1.20.0 released January 2022. Updates include extended programming language support for DialogServiceConnector, Unity on Linux, enhancements to IntentRecognizer, added support for Python 3.10, and a fix to remove a 10-second delay while stopping a speech recognizer (when using a PushAudioInputStream, and no new audio is pushed in after StopContinuousRecognition is called).
* Speech CLI 1.20.0 released January 2022. Updates include microphone input for Speaker recognition and expanded support for Intent recognition.
* Speaker Recognition service is generally available (GA). With [Speaker Recognition](./speaker-recognition-overview.md) you can accurately verify and identify speakers by their unique voice characteristics.
* Custom Neural Voice extended to support [49 locales](./language-support.md#custom-neural-voice).
* Prebuilt Neural Voice added new [languages and variants](./language-support.md#prebuilt-neural-voices).
