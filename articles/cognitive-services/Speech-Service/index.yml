abstract: 
  description: The cloud-based Microsoft Speech Service and SDK provides developers an easy way to create powerful speech-enabled features in their applications, like voice command control, user dialog using natural speech conversation, and speech transcription and dictation. Cortana, Microsoft Office, and others use the same technology. A key differentiator of Microsoft Speech Service is the ability to <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-to-text/concepts/custom-models?branch=pr-en-us-36555">customize Speech-to-Text</a> acoustic and language models to accommodate specialized vocabulary, noisy environments, and different ways of speaking. In fact, <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/text-to-speech/concepts/custom-voice?branch=pr-en-us-36555">customized Text-to-speech</a> and <a href="http://aka.ms/customtranslator">customized Speech-Translation</a> are available as well.<br/>Our Speech SDK is available on multiple platforms in several programming languages -- taking care of live microphone management, real-time streaming, or batch-based file communication depending on your applications needs.
