This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for Go on Linux. 

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

## System requirements

Before you install the Speech SDK for Go, you need:

* Linux environment set up as described in the [system requirements and setup instructions](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md#get-the-speech-sdk)
* The [Go binary version 1.13 or later](https://golang.org/dl/) installed

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-sdk](linux-install-sdk.md)]

## Configure the Go environment

The following steps enable your Go environment to find the Speech SDK. In both steps, replace `<architecture>` with the processor architecture of your CPU. This will be `x86`, `x64`, `arm32`, or `arm64`.

1. Because the bindings rely on `cgo`, you need to set the environment variables so Go can find the SDK. 

   ```sh
   export CGO_CFLAGS="-I$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/include/c_api"
   export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/<architecture> -lMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core"
   ```

1. To run applications and the SDK, you need to tell the operating system where to find the libraries. 

   ```sh
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/<architecture>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
   ```
