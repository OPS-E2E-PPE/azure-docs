In this quickstart you will use the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) to interactively recognize speech from audio data captured from a microphone. After satisfying a few prerequisites, recognizing speech from a microphone only takes four steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a `SpeechConfig` object from your subscription key and region.
> * Create a `SpeechRecognizer` object using the `SpeechConfig` object from above.
> * Using the `SpeechRecognizer` object, start the recognition process for a single utterance.
> * Inspect the `SpeechRecognitionResult` returned.
