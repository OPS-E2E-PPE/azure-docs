In this guide, you learn common design patterns for doing text-to-speech synthesis. 

See the text-to-speech [overview](../../../text-to-speech.md) for more information about:

* Getting responses as in-memory streams.
* Customizing output sample rate and bit rate.
* Submitting synthesis requests by using Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).
* Using neural voices.
