[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-ai-textanalytics/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true&view=azure-python) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics)


Use this quickstart to create a language detection application with the client library for Python. In the following example, you will create a Python application that can identify the language a text sample was written in.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../../../includes/use-language-studio.md)]


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0
```

## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. Then run the code.  

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```python
key = "paste-your-key-here"
endpoint = "paste-your-endpoint-here"

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example method for detecting the language of text
def language_detection_example(client):
    try:
        documents = ["Ce document est rédigé en Français."]
        response = client.detect_language(documents = documents, country_hint = 'us')[0]
        print("Language: ", response.primary_language.name)

    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
language_detection_example(client)
```

### Output

```console
Language:  French
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)
