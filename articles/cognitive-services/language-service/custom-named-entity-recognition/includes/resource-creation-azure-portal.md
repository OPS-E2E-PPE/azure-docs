### Create a new resource from the Azure portal

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) to create a new Azure Language resource. 

1. In the window that appears, select **Custom text classification & custom named entity recognition (preview)** from the custom features. Click **Continue to create your resource** at the bottom of the screen.

1. Create a Language resource with following details.

    |Instance detail  | Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Location | The [location](../service-limits.md#regional-availability) of your Language resource. You can use "West US 2" for this quickstart.   |
    |Pricing tier     | The [pricing tier](../service-limits.md#language-resource-limits) for your Language resource. You can use the Free (F0) tier for this quickstart.       |

1. In the **Custom text classification & custom named entity recognition** section, select an existing storage account or select **New storage account**. These values are to help you get started, and not necessarily the [storage account values](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) youâ€™ll want to use in production environments. To avoid latency during building your project connect to storage accounts in the same region as your Language resource.

    |Storage account value  |Recommended value  |
    |---------|---------|
    | Name | Any name |
    | Account kind| Storage (general purpose v1) |
    | Performance | Standard |
    | Replication | Locally redundant storage (LRS) |

1. Make sure the **Responsible AI Notice** is checked. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page, then select **Create**.
