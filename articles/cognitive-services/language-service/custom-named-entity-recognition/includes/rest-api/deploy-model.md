```rest
{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/analyze-text/projects/{PROJECT-NAME}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}?api-version=2021-11-01-preview
```

|Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`{YOUR-ENDPOINT}`     | The endpoint for authenticating your API request.   | `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.  | `myProject` |
|`{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}`     | The name of your deployment. This value is case-sensitive.  | `prod` |

### Headers

Use the following header to authenticate your request. 

|Key|Value|
|--|--|
|`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`| The key to your resource. Used for authenticating your API requests.|

### Request body

Use the following JSON in your request. Use the name of the model you want to deploy.  

```json
{
  "trainedModelLabel": "MyModel",
  "deploymentName": "prod"
}
```

Once you send your API request, youâ€™ll receive a `202` response indicating success. In the response headers, extract the `location` value. It will be formatted like this: 

```rest
{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/analyze-text/projects/{YOUR-PROJECT-NAME}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}/jobs/{JOB-ID}?api-version=2021-11-01-preview
``` 

`JOB-ID` is used to identify your request, since this operation is asynchronous. You will use this URL in the next step to get the publishing status.

## Get the deployment status

Use the following **GET** request to query the status of your model's publishing process. You can use the URL you received from the previous step, or replace the placeholder values below with your own values. 

```rest
{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/analyze-text/projects/{YOUR-PROJECT-NAME}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}/jobs/{JOB-ID}?api-version=2021-11-01-preview
```

|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.  | `myProject` |
|`{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}`     | The name of your deployment. This value is case-sensitive.  | `prod` |
|`{JOB-ID}`     | The ID for locating your model's training status. This is in the `location` header value you received in the previous step.  | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
