> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the Language resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **Keys and Endpoint** page, under **Resource Management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).
