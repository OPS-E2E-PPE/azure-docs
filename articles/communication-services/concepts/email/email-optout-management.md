# Overview

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

This article provides Email delivery best practices and describes how to use the Azure Communication Services Email suppression list. This feature enables customers to manage opt-out capabilities for email communications. It also provides information about the features that are important for emails opt out management. Use these features to improve email compliance management, promote better email practices, increase your email delivery success, and boost the likelihood of reaching recipient inboxes.

## Opt out or unsubscribe management: Ensuring transparent sender reputation
It's important to know how interested your customers are in your email communication and to respect their opt-out or unsubscribe requests when they decide not to get emails from you. This helps you keep a good sender reputation. Whether you have a manual or automated process in place for handling unsubscribes, it's important to provide an "unsubscribe" link in the email payload you send. When recipients decide not to receive further emails, they can click on the 'unsubscribe' link to remove their email address from your mailing list.

The function of the links and instructions in the email is vital. They must be working correctly and promptly notify the application mailing list to remove the contact from the appropriate list or lists. A proper unsubscribe mechanism should be explicit and transparent from the subscriber's perspective. This helps ensure that they know precisely which messages they're unsubscribing from. Ideally, they should be offered a preferences center that gives them the option to unsubscribe in cases where they're subscribed to multiple lists within your organization. This process prevents accidental unsubscribes and enables users to manage their opt-in and opt-out preferences effectively through the unsubscribe management process.

## Managing emails opt out preferences with suppression list in Azure Communication Service Email

Azure Communication Service Email offers a powerful platform with a centralized managed unsubscribe list with opt-out preferences saved to our data store. This feature helps developers meet the guidelines of email providers, requiring one-click list-unsubscribe implementation in the emails sent from our platform. To proactively identify and avoid significant delivery problems, suppression list features include but aren't limited to:

* Offers domain-level, customer managed lists that provide opt-out capabilities.
* Provides Azure resources that allow for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations via Azure portal, Management SDKs, or REST APIs.
* Apply filters in the sending pipeline, all recipients are filtered against the addresses in the domain suppression lists and email delivery isn't attempted for the recipient addresses.
* Gives the ability to manage a suppression list for each sender email address, which is used to filter/suppress email recipient addresses when sending emails.
* Caches suppression list data to reduce expensive database lookups, and this caching is domain-specific based on the frequency of use.
* Adds Email addresses programmatically for an easy opt-out process for unsubscribing.

### Benefits of opt out or unsubscribe management

Using a suppression list in Azure Communication Services offers several benefits:
* Compliance and Legal Considerations: Use opt-out links to meet legal responsibilities defined in local government legislation like the CAN-SPAM Act in the United States. It ensures that customers can easily manage opt-outs and maintain compliance with these regulations.
*	Better Sender Reputation: When emails aren't sent to users who opted out, it helps protect the senderâ€™s reputation and lower the chance of being blocked by email providers.
* Improved User Experience: It respects the preferences of users who don't wish to receive communications. Collecting and storing email preferences lead to a better user experience and potentially higher engagement rates with recipients who choose to receive emails.
*	Operational Efficiency: Suppression lists can be managed programmatically. Use this feature to efficiently handle large numbers of opt-out requests without manual intervention. 
*	Cost-Effectiveness: By not sending emails to recipients who opted out, it reduces the volume of sent emails. This can lower operational costs associated with email delivery.
*	Data-Driven Decisions: The suppression list feature provides insights into the number of opt-outs. Use this valuable data to make informed decisions about email campaign strategies.

These benefits contribute to a more efficient, compliant, and user-friendly email communication system using Azure Communication Services.
