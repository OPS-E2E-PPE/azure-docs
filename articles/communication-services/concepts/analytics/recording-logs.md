# Call Recording Summary Log
Call recording summary logs provide details about the call duration, media content (e.g., Audio-Video, Unmixed, Transcription, etc.), the format types used for the recording (e.g., WAV, MP4, etc.), as well as the reason of why the recording ended.

Recording file is generated at the end of a call or meeting. The recording can be initiated and stopped by either a user or an app (bot) or ended  due to a system failure.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Please note the call recording logs will be published once the call recording is ready to be downloaded. The log will be published within the standard latency time for Azure Monitor Resource logs see [Log data ingestion time in Azure Monitor](../../../azure-monitor/logs/data-ingestion-time.md#azure-metrics-resource-logs-activity-log)

## Call recording and sample data
```json
"operationName":            "Call Recording Summary",
"operationVersion":         "1.0",
"category":                 "RecordingSummaryPUBLICPREVIEW",

```
A call can have one recording or many recordings depending on how many times a recording event is triggered.

For example, if an agent initiates an outbound call in a recorded line and the call drops due to poor network signal, the `callid` will have one `recordingid`. If the agent calls back the customer, the system will generate a new `callid` as well as a new `recordingid`. 


#### Example1: Call recording for "One call to one recording"
```json
"properties"
{  
  "TimeGenerated":"2022-08-17T23:18:26.4332392Z",
    "OperationName": "RecordingSummary",
    "Category": "CallRecordingSummary",
    "CorrelationId": "zzzzzz-cada-4164-be10-0000000000",
    "ResultType": "Succeeded",
    "Level": "Informational",
    "RecordingId": "eyJQbGF0Zm9ybUVuZHBvaW5xxxxxxxxFmNjkwxxxxxxxxxxxxSZXNvdXJjZVNwZWNpZmljSWQiOiJiZGU5YzE3Ni05M2Q3LTRkMWYtYmYwNS0yMTMwZTRiNWNlOTgifQ",
    "RecordingEndReason": "CallEnded",
    "RecordingStartTime": "2022-08-16T09:07:54.0000000Z",
    "RecordingLength": "73872.94",
    "ChunkCount": 6,
   "ContentType": "Audio - Video",
    "ChannelType": "mixed",
    "FormatType": "mp4",
    "AudioChannelsCount": 1
}
```

If the agent initiated a recording and stopped and restarted the recording  multiple times while the call is still on, the `callid` will have many `recordingid` depending on how many times the recording events were triggered.

#### Example2: Call recording for "One call to many recordings"
```json
