# Experience for users in Teams client
Teams guest joining Teams meeting with Azure Communication Services SDKs will be represented in Teams client as any other Teams anonymous user. Teams guests will be marked as "external" in the participant's lists as Teams clients. As Teams anonymous users, their capabilities in the Teams meeting will be limited regardless of the assigned Teams meeting role.

## Next steps

- [Authenticate as Teams guest](../../../quickstarts/access-tokens.md)
- [Join Teams meeting audio and video as Teams guest](../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-teams-interop.md)
- [Join Teams meeting chat as Teams guest](../../../quickstarts/chat/meeting-interop.md)
- [Join meeting options](../../../how-tos/calling-sdk/teams-interoperability.md)
- [Communicate as Teams user](../../teams-endpoint.md).
