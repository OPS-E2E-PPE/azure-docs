# Picture-in-Picture 

While being in the call, user is presented with full screen UI, which prevents user from multitasking in the App while still on the call.

There are two ways to enable user to multitask in the App:
- Enabling multitasking - user is able to click Back button which, takes user back to the previous screen. No Calling UI is visible to user while still on the call.
- Enable Picture-in-Picture, in additions, will display a system Picture-in-Picture with outgoing call. Please note Picture-in-Picture is using system provided Picture-in-Picture feature and is a subject of the feature support on the device, CPU load, RAM availability, battery state etc.
