## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7+ for your operating system.

## Sample code

You can review and download the sample code for this quick start on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-python-quickstarts/tree/main/rooms-quickstart).

## Setting up

### Create a new Python application

In a terminal or console window, create a new folder for your application and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir acs-rooms-quickstart && cd acs-rooms-quickstart
```

### Install the packages

You'll need to use the Azure Communication Rooms client library for Python [version 1.0.0b2](https://pypi.org/project/azure-communication-rooms/) or above. 

From a console prompt, navigate to the directory containing the rooms.py file, then execute the following command:

```console
pip install azure-communication-rooms
pip install azure-communication-identity
```

### Set up the app framework

Create a new file called `rooms-quickstart.py` and add the basic program structure.

```python

import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from azure.communication.rooms import (
    RoomsClient,
    RoomParticipant,
    RoleType,
    RoomJoinPolicy
)
from azure.communication.identity import CommunicationUserIdentifier

class RoomsQuickstart(object):
    print("Azure Communication Services - Rooms Quickstart")
    #room method implementations goes here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rooms = RoomsQuickstart()
```

## Initialize a room client

Create a new `RoomsClient` object that will be used to create new `rooms` and manage their properties and lifecycle. The connection string of your `Communications Service` will be used to authenticate the request. For more information on connection strings, see [this page](../../create-communication-resource.md#access-your-connection-strings-and-service-endpoints).

```python
#Find your Communication Services resource in the Azure portal
self.connection_string = os.getenv("COMMUNICATION_CONNECTION_STRING") or <COMMUNICATION_SAMPLES_CONNECTION_STRING>
self.rooms_client = RoomsClient.from_connection_string(self.connection_string)
```

## Create a room

Create a new `room` with default properties using the code snippet below:

```python
# Create a Room
valid_from = datetime.now()
valid_until = valid_from + relativedelta(months=+1)

# Create identities for users
identity_client = CommunicationIdentityClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
user1 = identity_client.create_user_and_token(scopes=[CommunicationTokenScope.VOIP])
user2 = identity_client.create_user_and_token(scopes=["voip"])

participants = []
participants.append(RoomParticipant(CommunicationUserIdentifier(user1.properties['id'])))

try:
    create_room_response = self.rooms_client.create_room(valid_from=valid_from, valid_until=valid_until, participants=participants)
    print("\nCreated a room with id: " + create_room_response.id)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

Since `rooms` are server-side entities, you may want to keep track of and persist the `roomId` in the storage medium of choice. You can reference the `roomId` to view or update the properties of a `room` object. 

## Get properties of an existing room

Retrieve the details of an existing `room` by referencing the `roomId`:

```python
# Retrieves the room with corresponding ID
try:
    get_room_response = self.rooms_client.get_room(room_id=room_id)
    print("\nRetrieved room with id: ", get_room_response.id);

except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

## Update the lifetime of a room

The lifetime of a `room` can be modified by issuing an update request for the `ValidFrom` and `ValidUntil` parameters. A room can be valid for a maximum of six months. 

```python
# set attributes you want to change
valid_from =  datetime.now()
valid_until = valid_from + relativedelta(months=+1,days=+20)

try:
    update_room_response = self.rooms_client.update_room(room_id=room_id, valid_from=valid_from, valid_until=valid_until)
    self.printRoom(response=update_room_response)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
``` 

## Add new participants 

To add new participants to a `room`, use the `add_participants` method exposed on the client.

```python

# Add Participants
try:
    participants = []
    participants.append(RoomParticipant(CommunicationUserIdentifier(user2.properties['id']), RoleType.ATTENDEE))
    self.rooms_client.add_participants(room_id, participants)
    print("\nAdded participants to room")

except Exception as ex:
    print('Error in adding participants to room.', ex)

```

Participants that have been added to a `room` become eligible to join calls.

## Get list of participants

Retrieve the list of participants for an existing `room` by referencing the `roomId`:

```python

# Get list of participants in room
try:
    participants = self.rooms_client.get_participants(room_id)
    print("\nRetrieved participants for room: ", participants)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)

```

## Remove participants

To remove a participant from a `room` and revoke their access, use the `remove_participants` method.

```python

# Remove Participants
participants = [CommunicationUserIdentifier(user2.properties['id'])]

try:
    remove_participants_response = self.rooms_client.remove_participants(room_id=room_id, communication_identifiers=participants)
    print("\nRemoved participants from room")
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)

```

## Delete room
If you wish to disband an existing `room`, you may issue an explicit delete request. All `rooms` and their associated resources are automatically deleted at the end of their validity plus a grace period. 

```python

# Delete Room
self.rooms_client.delete_room(room_id=room)
print("\nDeleted room with id: " + room)

```

## Run the code

To run the code, make sure you are on the directory where your `index.js` file is. 

```console

python rooms-quickstart.py

```


The expected output describes each completed action:

```console

Azure Communication Services - Rooms Quickstart
