# Plan your Azure Time Series Insights (preview) environment

This article describes best practices to plan and get started quickly using the Azure Time Series Insights (preview).

## Best practices for planning and preparation

It's best to have the following items ready before getting started:

* You've identified your **Time Series IDs**
* You have your **Timestamp** property ready
* You've built your **Time Series Model**
* You understand how to send events that are efficiently denormalized in JSON

Having these items ready helps to simplify planning and preparation. Additionally, it's wise to plan ahead and determine your business disaster recovery (BCDR) needs before you create your instance (and not afterwards). Doing so ahead of time helps to ensure your instance is maximally prepared.

> [!TIP]
> Configure your environment to suit your BCDR needs before and not after you create your instance.

The Azure TSI (preview) employs a pay-as-you-go business model. For more information about charges and capacity, see [Time Series Insights pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/time-series-insights).

## Configure your Time Series IDs and Timestamp properties

To create a new TSI environment, select a **Time Series ID**. Doing so acts as a logical partition for your data. As noted, make sure to have your **Time Series IDs** ready.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Time Series IDs** are **immutable** and **cannot be changed later**. Verify each before final selection and first use.

You can select up to **three** (3) keys to uniquely differentiate your resources. Read the [Best practices for choosing a Time Series ID](./time-series-insights-update-how-to-id.md) article for more information.

Each event source has an optional **Timestamp** property that's used to track event sources over time. **Timestamp** values are case-sensitive and must be formatted to the individual specification of each event source.

> [!TIP]
> Verify the formatting and parsing requirements for your event sources.

When left blank, the **Event Enqueue Time** of an event source is used as the event **Timestamp**. If you are sending historical data or batched events, you will likely find customizing the **Timestamp** property to be more helpful than the default **Event Enqueue Time**. For more information, read about [How to add event sources in IoT Hub](./time-series-insights-how-to-add-an-event-source-iothub.md).  

## Understand the Time Series Model

You can now configure your TSI environment’s **Time Series Model**. The new model makes it easy to find and analyze IoT data. It does so by enabling the curation, maintenance, and enrichment of time series data and helps to prepare consumer-ready data sets. The model uses **Time Series IDs**, which map to an instance associating the unique resource with variables (known as types) and hierarchies. Read about the new [Time Series Model](./time-series-insights-update-tsm.md).

The model is dynamic so it can built at any time. However, you’ll be able to get started more quickly if it’s built and uploaded prior to you beginning to push data into TSI. To build your model, review the [Time Series Model](./time-series-insights-update-tsm.md) article.

For many customers, we expect the **Time Series Model** to map to an existing asset model or ERP system already in place. For those customers that do not have an existing model, a pre-built user experience is [provided](https://github.com/Microsoft/tsiclient) to get up and running quickly.

## Shaping your events

It's important to verify the way you send events to TSI. Ideally, your events will be denormalized well and efficiently.

A good rule of thumb:

* Metadata should be stored in your **Time Series Model**
* **Time Series Mode;** instance fields and events should only necessary information such as:
  * **Time Series ID**
  * **Timestamp**

Review the [How to shape events](./time-series-insights-update-how-to-shape-events.md) article for greater detail.

## Business disaster recovery

As an Azure service, TSI is a high availability (HA) service using redundancies at the Azure region level. No configuration is required to use these inherent functionalities. The Microsoft Azure platform also includes features to help you build solutions with disaster recovery (DR) capabilities or cross-region availability. If you want to provide global, cross-region HA for devices or users, take advantage of these Azure DR features. The article [Azure Business Continuity Technical Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resiliency/resiliency-technical-guidance) describes the built-in features in Azure for business continuity and DR. The [Disaster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/resiliency/index) recovery and high availability for Azure applications paper provides architecture guidance on strategies for Azure applications to achieve HA and DR.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Time Series Insights does not have built-in BCDR.
> By default Azure Storage, Azure IoT Hub, and Event Hubs have recovery built in.

To learn more:

* Read about [Azure Storage’s redundancy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy).
* Read about [IoT Hub's HA DR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-ha-dr).
* Read about [Event Hub's policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-geo-dr).

Nevertheless, customers that require BCDR can still implement a recovery strategy by creating a second TSI environment in a backup Azure region. Customers send events to this secondary environment from the primary event source, leveraging a second dedicated consumer group and that event source's BCDR guidelines.

The specific steps to accomplish this are as follows:

1. Create an environment in a second region. Read about [TSI environments](./time-series-insights-get-started.md).
1. Create a second dedicated consumer group for your event source and connect that event source to the new environment. Be sure to designate the second, dedicated consumer group. Learn more from the [IoT Hub documentation](./time-series-insights-how-to-add-an-event-source-iothub.md) or the [Event Hub documentation](./time-series-insights-data-access.md).
1. If your primary region were impacted during a disaster incident, reroute operations to the backup TSI environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Note that a delay may be experienced in the event of a failover.
> * Failover may also cause a mometary spike in message processing as operations are rerouted.
> * For more information, review [Mitigating latency in TSI](./time-series-insights-environment-mitigate-latency.md).
