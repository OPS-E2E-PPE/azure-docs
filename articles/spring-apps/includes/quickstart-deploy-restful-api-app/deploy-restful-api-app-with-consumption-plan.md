<!-- 
For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to deploy to Azure Spring Apps with Consumption plan.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-restful-api-app-with-consumption-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-restful-api-app/deploy-restful-api-app-with-consumption-plan.md)]

-->

## 2. Prepare the Spring project

To deploy the RESTful API app, the first step is to prepare the Spring project to run locally.

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

Use the following steps to clone and run the app locally:

1. Use the following command to clone the sample project from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Restful-Application.git
   ```

1. If you want to run the app locally, complete the steps in the [Expose RESTful APIs](#expose-restful-apis) and [Update the application configuration](#update-the-application-configuration) sections first, and then use the following command to run the sample application with Maven:

   ```bash
   cd ASA-Samples-Restful-Application
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to initialize the web application from Azure Developer CLI templates:

1. Open a terminal, create a new empty folder, and then change directory to it.

1. Run the following command to initialize the project:

   ```bash
   azd init --template Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Restful-Application
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the login to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.
   - **Please enter a new environment name**: Provide an environment name. This name is used as a suffix for the resource group that's created to hold all the Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Initializing a new project (azd init)

   Downloading template code to: <your-local-path>
   (âœ“) Done: Initialized git repository

   Enter a new environment name: <your-env-name>

   SUCCESS: New project initialized!
   You can view the template code in your directory: <your-local-path>

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

1. Run the following command to log in to Azure with OAuth2. Ignore this step if you've already logged in.

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

1. Run the following command to enable the Azure Spring Apps feature:

   ```bash
   azd config set alpha.springapp on
   ```

1. Run the following command to package a deployable copy of your application, provision the template's infrastructure to Azure, and deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources:

   ```bash
   azd provision
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **Select an Azure Subscription to use**: Use arrows to move, type to filter, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   - **Select an Azure location to use**: Use arrows to move, type to filter, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name>> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<your-resource-group>/overview
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This command might take a while to complete. You see a progress indicator as it provisions Azure resources.

### Expose RESTful APIs

Use the following steps to expose your RESTful APIs in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directory + subscription** filter (:::image type="icon" source="../../media/quickstart-deploy-restful-api-app/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false":::) to select the tenant in which you want to register an application.

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.

1. Enter a name for your application in the **Name** field - for example, *Todo*. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.

1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts**.

1. Select **Register** to create the application.

1. On the app **Overview** page, look for the **Application (client) ID** value, and then record it for later use. You need it to configure the YAML configuration file for this project.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**, find the **Application ID URI** at the beginning of the page, and then select **Add**.

1. On the **Edit application ID URI** page, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{client ID}`) or use a meaningful name instead of the client ID, such as `api://simple-todo`, and then select **Save**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API** > **Add a scope**, and then enter the following information:

   - For **Scope name**, enter *ToDo.Read*.
   - For **Who can consent**, select **Admins only**.
   - For **Admin consent display name**, enter *Read the ToDo data*.
   - For **Admin consent description**, enter *Allows authenticated users to read the ToDo data.*.
   - For **State**, keep it enabled.
   - Select **Add scope**.

1. Repeat the previous step to add the two other scopes: *ToDo.Write* and *ToDo.Delete*.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstart-deploy-restful-api-app/expose-an-api.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Expose an API page of a RESTful API application." lightbox="../../media/quickstart-deploy-restful-api-app/expose-an-api.png":::

### Update the application configuration

Use the following steps to update the YAML file to use your Microsoft Entra registered application information to establish a relationship with the RESTful API application:

1. Use the following YAML to update the `spring.cloud.azure.active-directory` configuration in the configuration file. Be sure to replace the placeholders with your own values that you created previously.

   ```yaml
   spring:
     cloud:
       azure:
         active-directory:
           profile:
             tenant-id: <your-Microsoft-Entra-ID-tenant-ID>
           credential:
             client-id: <your-application-ID-of-ToDo>
           app-id-uri: <your-application-ID-URI-of-ToDo>
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > In v1.0 tokens, the configuration requires the client ID of the API, while in v2.0 tokens, you can use the client ID or the application ID URI in the request. You can configure both to properly complete the audience validation.

1. Use the following command to rebuild the sample project:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

## 4. Deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps

Now, you can deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps.

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

Use the following steps to deploy using the [Maven plugin for Azure Spring Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Spring-Apps):

1. Navigate to the sample project directory and run the following command to configure the app in Azure Spring Apps:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw com.microsoft.azure:azure-spring-apps-maven-plugin:1.18.0:config
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the login to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.
   - **Select subscription**: Select the subscription list number of the Azure Spring Apps instance you created, which defaults to the first subscription in the list. If you use the default number, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> directly.
   - **Select Azure Spring Apps for deployment**: Select the number of the Azure Spring Apps instance you created. If you use the default number, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> directly.
   - **Input the app name(simple-todo-api)**: Input a name for your application deployment on Azure Spring Apps. If you use the default name, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> directly.
   - **Expose public access for this app (RESTful API for SimpleTodo)?**: Press <kbd>y</kbd>.
   - **Confirm to save all the above configurations (Y/n)**: Press <kbd>y</kbd>. If you press <kbd>n</kbd>, the configuration isn't saved.

1. Use the following command to deploy the app:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw azure-spring-apps:deploy
   ```

   The following list describes the command interaction:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the login to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.

   After the command is executed, you can see the following log output, indicating that the deployment was successful.

   ```output
   [INFO] App(simple-todo-api) is successfully updated.
   [INFO] Deployment Status: Running
   [INFO]   InstanceName:simple-todo-api--default-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx  Status:Running Reason:null       DiscoverStatus:NONE
   [INFO] Getting public url of app(simple-todo-api)...
   [INFO] Application url: https://simple-todo-api.xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx.xxxxxx.azurecontainerapps.io
   ```

   The output **Application url** is the base endpoint to access the ToDo API application.

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to package the app, provision the Azure resources required by the web application, and then deploy to Azure Spring Apps.

1. Run the following command to package a deployable copy of your application:

   ```bash
   azd package
   ```

1. Run the following command to deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources:

   ```bash
   azd deploy
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Deploying services (azd deploy)
   
   WARNING: Feature 'springapp' is in alpha stage.
   To learn more about alpha features and their support, visit https://aka.ms/azd-feature-stages.
   
   ...
   
   Deploying service simple-todo-api (Fetching endpoints for spring app service)
   - Endpoint: https://simple-todo-api.xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx.xxxxxx.azurecontainerapps.io
   
   
   SUCCESS: Your application was deployed to Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-<your-environment-name>/overview
   ```

   The output **Endpoint** is the base endpoint to access the ToDo API application.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `azd up` to combine the previous three commands: `azd provision` (provisions Azure resources), `azd package` (packages a deployable copy of your application), and `azd deploy` (deploys application code). For more information, see [Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-API-Application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-API-Application).
