# About Azure Sentinel content and solutions

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Azure Sentinel **Content hub** and solutions are currently in **PREVIEW**, as are all individual solution packages. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Azure Sentinel *content* is Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) content that enables customers to ingest data, monitor, alert, hunt, investigate, respond, and connect with different products, platforms, and services in Azure Sentinel.

Content in Azure Sentinel includes any of the following types:

- **[Data connectors](connect-data-sources.md)** provide log ingestion from different sources into Azure Sentinel
- **[Parsers](normalization-about-parsers.md)** provide log formatting/transformation into [ASIM](normalization.md) formats, supporting usage across various Azure Sentinel content types and scenarios
- **[Workbooks](get-visibility.md)** provide monitoring, visualization, and interactivity with data in Azure Sentinel, highlighting meaningful insights for users
- **[Analytic rules](detect-threats-built-in.md)** provide alerts that point to relevant SOC actions via incidents
- **[Hunting queries](hunting.md)** are used by SOC teams to proactively hunt for threats in Azure Sentinel
- **[Notebooks](notebooks.md)** help SOC teams use advanced hunting features in Jupyter and Azure Notebooks
- **[Watchlists](watchlists.md)** support the ingestion of *specific* data for enhanced threat detection and reduced alert fatigue
- **[Playbooks and Azure Logic Apps custom connectors](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md)** provide features for automated investigations, remediations, and response scenarios in Azure Sentinel

Azure Sentinel *solutions* are packages of Azure Sentinel content or Azure Sentinel API integrations, which fulfill an end-to-end product, domain, or industry vertical scenario in Azure Sentinel.

> [!TIP]
> You can either customize out-of-the-box content for your own needs, or you can create your own solution with content to share with others in the community. For more information, see the [Azure Sentinel Solutions Build Guide](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsbuildguide) for solutions’ authoring and publishing.

## Discover and manage Azure Sentinel content

Use the Azure Sentinel **Content hub** to centrally discover and install out-of-the-box (built-in) content.

The Azure Sentinel Content Hub provides in-product discoverability, single-step deployment, and enablement of end-to-end product, domain, and/or vertical out-of-the-box solutions and content in Azure Sentinel.

- In the **Content hub**, filter by [categories](#azure-sentinel-out-of-the-box-content-and-solution-categories) and other parameters, or use the powerful text search, to find the content that works best for your organization's needs. The **Content hub** also indicates the [support model](#azure-sentinel-out-of-the-box-content-and-solution-support-models) applied to each piece of content, as some content is maintained by Microsoft and others are maintained by partners or the community.

    Manage [updates for out-of-the-box content](sentinel-solutions-deploy.md#install-or-update-a-solution) via the Azure Sentinel **Content hub**, and for custom content via the **Repositories** page.

- Customize out-of-the-box content for your own needs, or create custom content, including analytics rules, hunting queries, notebooks, workbooks, and more. Manage your custom content directly in your Azure Sentinel workspace, via the [Azure Sentinel API](/rest/api/securityinsights/), or in your own source control repository, via the Azure Sentinel [Repositories](ci-cd.md) page.

### Why content hub and solutions?

Azure Sentinel *solutions* are packaged content or integrations that deliver end-to-end product value for one or more domain or vertical scenarios.

The solutions experience is powered by [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace) for solutions’ discoverability and deployment. For more information, see the [Azure Sentinel Solutions Build Guide](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsbuildguide) for solutions authoring and publishing.

Azure Sentinel solutions provide in-product discoverability, single-step deployment, and enablement of end-to-end product, domain, and/or vertical scenarios in Azure Sentinel. This experience is powered by  for solutions’ discoverability, deployment, and enablement, and by  for solutions’ authoring and publishing.

- **Packaged content** are collections of one or more pieces of Azure Sentinel content, such as data connectors, workbooks, analytics rules, playbooks, hunting queries, watchlists, parsers, and more.

- **Integrations** include services or tools built using Azure Sentinel or Azure Log Analytics APIs that support integrations between Azure and existing customer applications, or migrate data, queries, and more, from those applications into Azure Sentinel.

You can also use solutions to install packages of out-of-the-box content in a single step, where the content is often ready to use immediately. Providers and partners can use solutions to productize investments by delivering combined product, domain, or vertical value.

Use the Content hub to centrally discover and deploy solutions and out-of-the-box content in a scenario-driven manner.

- [Azure Sentinel Content hub catalog](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md)
