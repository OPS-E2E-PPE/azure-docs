# Export historical data from QRadar

This article describes how to export your historical data from QRadar. After you complete the steps in this article, you can [select a target platform](migration-ingestion-target-platform.md) to host the exported data, and then [select an ingestion tool](migration-ingestion-tool.md) to migrate the data.

Follow the steps in these sections to export your historical data using [QRadar forwarding destination](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=administration-forward-data-other-systems).

## Configure QRadar forwarding destination

Configure the QRadar forwarding destination, including your profile, rules, and destination address:

1. [Configure a forwarding profile](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=systems-configuring-forwarding-profiles).
1. [Add a forwarding destination](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=systems-adding-forwarding-destinations):
    1. Set the **Event Format** to **JSON**.
    2. Set the **Destination Address** to a server that has syslog running on TCP port 5141 and stores the ingested logs to a local folder path.
    3. Select the forwarding profile created in step 1. 
    4. Enable the forwarding destination configuration.

## Configure routing rules

Configure routing rules:

1. [Configure routing rules to forward data](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=systems-configuring-routing-rules-forward-data).
1. Set the **Mode** to **Offline**.
1. Select the relevant **Forwarding Event Processor**.
1. Set the **Data Source** to **Events**.
1. Select **Add Filter** to add filter criteria for data that needs to be exported. For example, use the **Log Source Time** field to set a timestamp range.
1. Select **Forward** and select the forwarding destination created when you [configured the QRadar forwarding destination](#configure-qradar-forwarding-destination) in step 2.
1. [Enable the routing rule configuration](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=systems-viewing-managing-routing-rules).
1. Repeat steps 1-7 for each event processor from which you need to export data.
