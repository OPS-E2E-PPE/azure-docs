# The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) Process Event normalization schema reference (Public preview)

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

The Process Event normalization schema is used to describe the operating system activity of running and terminating a process. Such events are reported by operating systems and security systems, such as EDR (End Point Detection and Response) systems.

A process, as defined by OSSEM, is a containment and management object that represents a running instance of a program. While processes themselves do not run, they do manage threads that run and execute code.

For more information about normalization in Microsoft Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Process Event normalization schema is currently in PREVIEW. This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads.
>
> The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Parsers

Microsoft Sentinel provides the following built-in, product-specific process event parsers:

- **Security Events process creation (Event 4688)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Security Events process termination (Event 4689)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon process creation (Event 1)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon process termination (Event 5)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint process creation**

To use the unifying parsers that unify all of listed parsers and ensure that you analyze across all the configured sources, use the following table names in your queries:

- **imProcessCreate**, for queries that require process creation information. These queries are the most common case.
- **imProcessTerminate** for queries that require process termination information.
- **imProcessEvents** for queries that require both process creation and termination information. In such cases, the `EventType` field enables you to distinguish between the events, and is set to `ProcessCreate` or `ProcessTerminate`, respectively. Process termination events generally include a lot less information than process creation events.

Deploy the [unifying and source-specific parsers](normalization-about-parsers.md) from the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelProcessEvents).

For more information, see [ASIM parsers overview](normalization-parsers-overview.md).

## Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the [Process Event](normalization-about-schemas.md#the-process-entity) information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imProcess<Type><vendor><Product>`, where `Type` is either `Create`, `Terminate`, or `Event` if the parser implements both creation and termination events.

Add your KQL function to the `imProcess<Type>` and `imProcess` unifying parsers to ensure that any content using the [Process Event](normalization-about-schemas.md#the-process-entity) model also uses your new parser.

### Process Event-specific fields

The fields listed in the table below are specific to Process events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

The process event schema references the following entities, which are central to process creation and termination activity:

- **Actor**. The user that initiated the process creation or termination.
- **ActingProcess**. The process used by the Actor to initiate the process creation or termination.
- **TargetProcess**. The new process.
- **TargetUser**. The user whose credentials are used to create the new process.
- **ParentProcess**. The process that initiated the Actor Process.
