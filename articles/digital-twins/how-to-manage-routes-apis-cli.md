# Manage endpoints and routes in Azure Digital Twins (APIs and CLI)

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-route-selector.md](../../includes/digital-twins-route-selector.md)]

In Azure Digital Twins, you can route [event notifications](how-to-interpret-event-data.md) to downstream services, or to connect to compute resources. This is done by first setting up **endpoints** that can receive the events. You can then create  [**event routes**](concepts-route-events.md) that specify which events generated by Azure Digital Twins are delivered to which endpoints.

Endpoints and routes are managed with the [**EventRoutes APIs**](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md), the [.NET (C#) SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/digitaltwins/Azure.DigitalTwins.Core), or the [Azure Digital Twins CLI](how-to-use-cli.md). This article walks you through the process of creating endpoints and routes through these mechanisms.

They can also be managed through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For a version of this article that uses the portal instead, see [*Manage endpoints and routes (portal)*](how-to-manage-routes-portal.md).

## Prerequisites

* You'll need an **Azure account** (you can set one up for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)), and an **Azure Digital Twins instance** created in your Azure subscription. If you don't have an instance already, you can create one using the steps in [*How-to: Set up an instance and authentication*](how-to-set-up-instance-scripted.md).
* You'll need an instance created for Azure Digital Twins. Have the following values handy to proceed further in this article. 

    * Resource name
    * Resource group
    * Azure subscription

 If you want to create an instance, refer to [*how-to: set-up-instance-using-portal*](how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md) and continue further in this article. 
    
## Create an endpoint for Azure Digital Twins

These are the supported types of endpoints that you can create for your instance:
* [Event Grid](../event-grid/overview.md)
* [Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md)
* [Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md)

For more information on the different endpoint types, see [*Choose between Azure messaging services*](../event-grid/compare-messaging-services.md).

To link an endpoint to Azure Digital Twins, the event grid topic, event hub, or Service Bus that you're using for the endpoint needs to exist already. 

The following example shows how to create an event grid topic using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az eventgrid topic create -g <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-topic-name> -l <region>
```

> [!TIP]
> To output a list of Azure region names that can be passed into commands in the Azure CLI, run this command:
> ```azurecli
> az account list-locations -o table
> ```

Once you have created the topic, you can link it to Azure Digital Twins with the following command:

```azurecli
az dt endpoint create eventgrid --endpoint-name <Event-Grid-endpoint-name> --eventgrid-resource-group <Event-Grid-resource-group-name> --eventgrid-topic <your-Event-Grid-topic-name> -n <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
```

This makes the event grid topic available inside of Azure Digital Twins, under the name specified with the `--endpoint-name` argument. You will typically use that name as the target of an **event route**, which you'll create in the next section using the Azure Digital Twins service API.

Equivalent commands exist for Event Hub and Service Bus endpoints:

* Add Service Bus Topic endpoint (requires a pre-created Service Bus resource)
```azurecli 
az dt endpoint create servicebus --endpoint-name <Service-Bus-endpoint-name> --servicebus-resource-group <Service-Bus-resource-group-name> --servicebus-namespace <Service-Bus-namespace> --servicebus-topic <Service-Bus-topic-name> --servicebus-policy <Service-Bus-topic-policy> -n <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
```

* Add Event Hub endpoint (requires pre-created Event Hub resource)
```azurecli
az dt endpoint create eventhub --endpoint-name <Event-Hub-endpoint-name> --eventhub-resource-group <Event-Hub-resource-group> --eventhub-namespace <Event-Hub-namespace> --eventhub <Event-Hub-name> --eventhub-policy <Event-Hub-policy> -n <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
```

## Manage event routes with APIs and the C# SDK

To actually send data from Azure Digital Twins to an endpoint, you need to define an event route. Azure Digital Twins **EventRoutes APIs** let developers wire up event flow, throughout the system and to downstream services. Read more about event routes in [*Concepts: Routing Azure Digital Twins events*](concepts-route-events.md).

The samples in this section use the C# SDK.

**Prerequisite**: You need to create endpoints as described earlier in this article before you can move on to creating a route. You can proceed to creating an event route once your endpoints are finished setting up.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have recently deployed your endpoints, validate that they're finished deploying **before** attempting to use them for a new event route. If route deployment fails because the endpoints aren't ready, wait a few minutes and try again.
>
> If you are scripting this flow, you may want to account for this by building in 2-3 minutes of wait time for the endpoint service to finish deploying before moving on to route setup.

### Create an event route

Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition can contain these elements:
* The route ID you want to use
* The name of the endpoint you want to use
* A filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint 

If there is no route ID, no messages are routed outside of Azure Digital Twins. 
If there is a route ID and the filter is `true`, all messages are routed to the endpoint. 
If there is a route ID and a different filter is added, messages will be filtered based on the filter.

One route should allow multiple notifications and event types to be selected. 

`CreateEventRoute` is the SDK call that is used to add an event route. Here is an example of its usage:

```csharp
EventRoute er = new EventRoute("endpointName");
er.Filter("true"); //Filter allows all messages
await client.CreateEventRoute("routeName", er);
```

> [!TIP]
> All SDK functions come in synchronous and asynchronous versions.

### Event route sample code

The following code sample shows how to create, list, and delete an event route:
```csharp
try
{
    Console.WriteLine("Create a route: testRoute1");
    EventRoute er = new EventRoute("< your - endpoint - name >");
    // Make a filter that passes everything
    er.Filter = "true";
    client.CreateEventRoute("< your - route - name >", er);
    Console.WriteLine("Create route succeeded. Now listing routes:");
    Pageable <EventRoute> result = client.GetEventRoutes();
    foreach (EventRoute r in result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Route {r.Id} to endpoint {r.EndpointId} with filter {r.Filter} ");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Deleting routes:");
    foreach (EventRoute r in result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Deleting route {r.Id}:");
        client.DeleteEventRoute(r.Id);
    }
}
catch (RequestFailedException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"*** Error in event route processing ({e.ErrorCode}):\n${e.Message}");
}
```

### Filter events

Without filtering, endpoints receive a variety of events from Azure Digital Twins:
* Telemetry fired by [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) using the Azure Digital Twins service API
* Twin property change notifications, fired on property changes for any twin in the Azure Digital Twins instance
* Life-cycle events, fired when twins or relationships are created or deleted
* Model change events, fired when [models](concepts-models.md) configured in an Azure Digital Twins instance are added or deleted

You can restrict the events being sent by adding a filter to an endpoint.

To add a filter, you can use a PUT request to *https://{YourHost}/EventRoutes/myNewRoute?api-version=2020-05-31-preview* with the following body:

```json  
{
    "endpointName": "<endpoint-name>",
    "filter": "<filter-text>"
}
``` 

Here are the supported route filters. Use the detail in the *Filter text schema* column to replace the `<filter-text>` placeholder in the request body above.

## Manage endpoints and routes with CLI

Endpoints and routes can also be managed using the Azure Digital Twins CLI. The commands can be found in [*How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins CLI*](how-to-use-cli.md).
