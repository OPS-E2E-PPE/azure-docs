# Add blobs to objects in Azure Digital Twins

Blobs are unstructured representations of common file types, like pictures and logs. Blobs keep track of what kind of data they represent by using a MIME type (for example: "image/jpeg") and metadata (name, description, type, and so on).

Azure Digital Twins supports attaching blobs to devices, spaces, and users. Blobs can represent a profile picture for a user, a device photo, a video, a map, a firmware zip, JSON data, a log, etc.

[!INCLUDE [Digital Twins Management API familiarity](../../includes/digital-twins-familiarity.md)]

## Uploading blobs: an overview

You can use multipart requests to upload blobs to specific endpoints and their respective functionalities.

[!INCLUDE [Digital Twins multipart requests](../../includes/digital-twins-multipart.md)]

### Blob metadata

In addition to **Content-Type** and **Content-Disposition**, Azure Digital Twins blob multipart requests must specify the correct JSON body. Which JSON body to submit depends on the kind of HTTP request operation that's being performed.

The four main JSON schemas are:

![JSON schemas][1]

The Swagger documentation describes these model schemas in full detail.

[!INCLUDE [Digital Twins Swagger](../../includes/digital-twins-swagger.md)]

Learn about using the reference documentation by reading [How to use Swagger](./how-to-use-swagger.md).

### Examples

[!INCLUDE [Digital Twins Management API](../../includes/digital-twins-management-api.md)]

To upload a text file as a blob and associate it with a space, make an authenticated HTTP POST request to:

```plaintext
YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_URL/spaces/blobs
```

With the following body:

```plaintext
--USER_DEFINED_BOUNDARY
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="metadata"

{
  "ParentId": "54213cf5-285f-e611-80c3-000d3a320e1e",
  "Name": "My First Blob",
  "Type": "Map",
  "SubType": "GenericMap",
  "Description": "A well chosen description",
  "Sharing": "None"
}
--USER_DEFINED_BOUNDARY
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="contents"; filename="myblob.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

This is my blob content. In this case, some text, but I could also be uploading a picture, an JSON file, a firmware zip, etc.

--USER_DEFINED_BOUNDARY--
```

| Value | Replace with |
| --- | --- |
| USER_DEFINED_BOUNDARY | A multipart content boundary name |

The following code is a .NET implementation of the same blob upload, using the class [MultipartFormDataContent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.multipartformdatacontent):

```csharp
//Supply your metadata in a suitable format
var multipartContent = new MultipartFormDataContent("USER_DEFINED_BOUNDARY");

var metadataContent = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(metaData), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
metadataContent.Headers.ContentType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse("application/json; charset=utf-8");
multipartContent.Add(metadataContent, "metadata");

var fileContents = new StringContent("MY_BLOB.txt");
fileContents.Headers.ContentType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse("text/plain");
multipartContent.Add(fileContents, "contents");

var response = await httpClient.PostAsync("spaces/blobs", multipartContent);
```

In both examples:

1. Verify that the headers include: `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary="USER_DEFINED_BOUNDARY"`.
1. Verify that the body is multipart:

   - The first part contains the required blob metadata.
   - The second part contains the text file.

1. Verify that the text file is supplied as `Content-Type: text/plain`.

## API endpoints

The following sections describe the core blob-related API endpoints and their functionalities.

### Devices

You can attach blobs to devices. The following image shows the Swagger reference documentation for your Management APIs. It specifies device-related API endpoints for blob consumption and any required path parameters to pass into them.

![Device blobs][2]

For example, to update or create a blob and attach the blob to a device, make an authenticated HTTP PATCH request to:

```plaintext
YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_URL/devices/blobs/YOUR_BLOB_ID
```

| Parameter | Replace with |
| --- | --- |
| *YOUR_BLOB_ID* | The desired blob ID |

Successful requests return a **DeviceBlob** JSON object in the response. **DeviceBlob** objects conform to the following JSON schema:

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DeviceBlobType** | String | A blob category that can be attached to a device | `Model` and `Specification` |
| **DeviceBlobSubtype** | String | A blob subcategory that's more specific than **DeviceBlobType** | `PhysicalModel`, `LogicalModel`, `KitSpecification`, and `FunctionalSpecification` |

> [!TIP]
> Use the preceding table to handle successfully returned request data.

### Spaces

You can also attach blobs to spaces. The following image lists all space API endpoints responsible for handling blobs. It also lists any path parameters to pass into those endpoints.

![Space blobs][3]

For example, to return a blob attached to a space, make an authenticated HTTP GET request to:

```plaintext
YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_URL/spaces/blobs/YOUR_BLOB_ID
```

| Parameter | Replace with |
| --- | --- |
| *YOUR_BLOB_ID* | The desired blob ID |

A PATCH request to the same endpoint updates metadata descriptions and creates new versions of the blob. The HTTP request is made through the PATCH method, along with any necessary meta, and multipart form data.

Successful operations return a **SpaceBlob** object that conforms to the following schema. You can use it to consume returned data.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SpaceBlobType** | String | A blob category that can be attached to a space | `Map` and `Image` |
| **SpaceBlobSubtype** | String | A blob subcategory that's more specific than **SpaceBlobType** | `GenericMap`, `ElectricalMap`, `SatelliteMap`, and `WayfindingMap` |

### Users

You can attach blobs to user models (for example, to associate a profile picture). The following image shows relevant user API endpoints and any required path parameters, like `id`:

![User blobs][4]

For example, to fetch a blob attached to a user, make an authenticated HTTP GET request with any required form data to:

```plaintext
YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_URL/users/blobs/YOUR_BLOB_ID
```

| Parameter | Replace with |
| --- | --- |
| *YOUR_BLOB_ID* | The desired blob ID |

The returned JSON (**UserBlob** objects) conforms to the following JSON models:

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **UserBlobType** | String | A blob category that can be attached to a user | `Image` and `Video` |
| **UserBlobSubtype** |  String | A blob subcategory that's more specific than **UserBlobType** | `ProfessionalImage`, `VacationImage`, and `CommercialVideo` |

## Common errors

A common error is to not include the correct header information:

```JSON
{
    "error": {
        "code": "400.600.000.000",
        "message": "Invalid media type in first section."
    }
}
```
