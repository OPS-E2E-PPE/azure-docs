# Data ingress and egress for Azure Digital Twins

Azure Digital Twins is typically used together with other services to create flexible, connected solutions that use your data in different kinds of ways. This article covers data ingress and egress for Azure Digital Twins and Azure services that can be used to take advantage of it.

Using [event routes](concepts-route-events.md), Azure Digital Twins can receive data from upstream services such as [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md) or [Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md), which are used to deliver telemetry and notifications. 

Azure Digital Twins can also route data to downstream services, such as [Azure Maps](../azure-maps/about-azure-maps.md) and [Time Series Insights](../time-series-insights/overview-what-is-tsi.md), for storage, workflow integration, analytics, and more. 

## Data ingress

Azure Digital Twins can be driven with data and events from any serviceâ€”[IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md), [Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md), your own custom service, and more. This kind of data flow allows you to collect telemetry from physical devices in your environment, and process this data using the Azure Digital Twins graph in the cloud.

Instead of having a built-in IoT Hub behind the scenes, Azure Digital Twins allows you to "bring your own" IoT Hub to use with the service. You can use an existing IoT Hub you currently have in production, or deploy a new one to be used for this purpose. This functionality gives you full access to all of the device management capabilities of IoT Hub.

To ingest data from any source into Azure Digital Twins, use an [Azure function](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). Learn more about this pattern in [Ingest telemetry from IoT Hub](how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data.md), or try it out yourself in the Azure Digital Twins [Connect an end-to-end solution](tutorial-end-to-end.md). 

You can also learn how to connect Azure Digital Twins to a Logic Apps trigger in [Integrate with Logic Apps](how-to-integrate-logic-apps.md).

## Data egress services

You may want to send Azure Digital Twins data to other downstream services for storage or additional processing.

To send twin data to [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview), set up a [data history (preview) connection](concepts-data-history.md) that automatically historizes digital twin property updates from your Azure Digital Twins instance to an Azure Data Explorer cluster. You can then query this data in Azure Data Explorer using the [Azure Digital Twins query plugin for Azure Data Explorer](concepts-data-explorer-plugin.md).

To send data to other services, such as [Azure Maps](../azure-maps/about-azure-maps.md), [Time Series Insights](../time-series-insights/overview-what-is-tsi.md), or [Azure Storage](../storage/common/storage-introduction.md), start by attaching the destination service to an *endpoint*. 

Endpoints can be instances of any of these Azure services:
* [Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md)
* [Event Grid](../event-grid/overview.md)
* [Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md)

The endpoint is attached to an Azure Digital Twins instance using management APIs or the Azure portal, and can carry data along from the instance to other listening services. For more information about Azure Digital Twins endpoints, see [Endpoints and event routes](concepts-route-events.md).

For detailed instructions on how to send Azure Digital Twins data to Azure Maps, see [Use Azure Digital Twins to update an Azure Maps indoor map](how-to-integrate-maps.md). For detailed instructions on how to send Azure Digital Twins data to Time Series Insights, see [Integrate with Time Series Insights](how-to-integrate-time-series-insights.md).

Azure Digital Twins implements *at least once* delivery for data emitted to egress services.
