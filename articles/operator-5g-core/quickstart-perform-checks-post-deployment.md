# Perform health and configuration checks post-deployment in Azure Operator 5G Core Preview

After Azure Operator 5G Core Preview is deployed, you can perform health and configuration checks on the deployment. You must enable an ARC extension to monitor your deployment. 

## Set up the Azure CLI

1. Sign in using the `az login--use-device-code` command. Complete the sign in process with your user account.
1. Set the subscription: `az account set -s <subscriptionName>`
1. Run the following commands to install the CLI extensions:

   `az extension add --yes --name connectedk8s`

    `az extension add --yes --name k8s-configuration`

    `az extension add --yes --name k8s-extension`

## Configure ARC for the Kubernetes/Azure Kubernetes Services Cluster

Enter the following command to configure the ARC:
`az connectedk8s connect --name <ConnectedK8sName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName>`

## Deploy the Azure Operator 5G Core Preview extension

1. Enter the following commands to deploy the Azure Operator 5G Core extension:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create \ 
    --name ao5gc-monitor \ 
    --cluster-name <ConnectedK8sName>   \ 
    --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \ 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \ 
    --extension-type "Microsoft.AO5GC" \ 
    --release-train <dev or preview or stable>\ 
    --auto-upgrade true
    ```

2. Run the `kubectl label namespace ao5gc-monitor name=ao5gc-monitor` command to create a **name=ao5gc-monitor** label for the newly created **ao5gc-monitor** namespace.

    The namespace and all necessary Azure Operator 5G Core extension pods, configuration maps, and services are created within the namespace.  

To delete the Azure Operator 5G Core extension, you can run the following command:

```azurecli
az k8s-extension delete \ 
--name ao5gc-monitor \ 
--cluster-name <ConnectedK8sName>   \ 
--resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \ 
--cluster-type connectedClusters \
```

## Set permission for Azure Operator 5G Core Preview extension to access metrics

By default, the fed-prometheus cluster can be reached only from a small set of predefined namespaces. You must add the newly created **ao5gc-monitor** to the allowlist to obtain observability metrics.

To add the namespace to fed-prometheus:

1. Run the following command to add the helm values into a file for fed-prometheus:
    `helm get values fed-prometheus -n  fed-prometheus â€“all> fed-prometheus_values.yaml`
2. Add the **ao5gc-monitor** namespace under **ingressTrafficNamespaces** at the global level.
1. Upgrade the fed-prometheus with the new helm values by running the following command:
    `helm upgrade fed-prometheus -n fed-prometheus fed-prometheus-4.3.0-46-rel-4-3-0.tgz -f fed-prometheus_values.yaml`
