# Azure Cosmos DB documentation experiment

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database. Because you can do so much with Azure Cosmos DB - from creating a graph to creating a document database, or migrating your data from MongoDB, Cassandra, or Azure Table storage - organizing the documentation can be a challenge. So we'd like your help.

We are testing the organization of the Azure Cosmos DB table of contents and [landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/), as shown in the following images, and we'd like to get your feedback on these proposed changes. 

**Original page and table of contents**

**Experimental page and table of contents**

## To load both views

1. To open both views side by side, navigate to the [landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) from your favorite web browser. 
2. Use the images above to determine which version you see, original, or experimental. 
3. Open an inprivate or incognito browser window and load the [landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) in the new browser window and again use the images to determine which version you see. 

   If you don't have both views present, close and reopen a new inprivate or incognito window and load the [landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) again. It may take a few tries to get both versions loaded in separate windows. Refreshing the incognito window will not load the other version, you need to open a new window. 

4. You can then resize the windows to fix side by side, or switch back and forth between views to compare. 

5. After you've had a chance to get familiar with the organization and layout of the experimental experience, click the **Experiment survey** button below to provide feedback. Submit the form no later than midnight April 4, 2018 so that the feedback can be reviewed and incorporated.
