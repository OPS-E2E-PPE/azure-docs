- This article requires version 2.12.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/cosmosdb/table/serverless.sh" range="4-24":::

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cli-clean-up-resources.md](../../../../../includes/cli-clean-up-resources.md)]

```azurecli
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
