# Manage cross-region replication on your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster (preview)

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore allows continuous data streaming to a replica cluster in another Azure region. That capability provides cross-region disaster recovery (DR) protection and read scalability across the regions. This document serves as a quick guide for developers who want to learn how to manage cross-region replication for their clusters.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

## Enable cross-region replication

To enable cross-region replication on a new cluster, follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps to [create a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster](./quickstart-portal.md#create-a-cluster).
1. On the **Basics** tab, select **Enable global distribution (preview)** flag.
1. Once cluster is created, on the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Global distribution**.
1. Select **Add replica** and select a region for cluster replica to be created in.
1. Verify your selection and select **Save** to confirm your selection.

## Promote a replica

To [promote a cluster replica](./cross-region-replication.md#replica-cluster-promotion) to a read-write cluster, follow these steps:

1. Select the cluster replica you would like to promote in the portal.
1. On the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Global distribution**.
1. On the **Global distribution** page, select **Promote**.
1. On the **Promote \<cluster name>** screen, double check the cluster replica's name, read the warning text, and select **Promote**.

After the cluster replica is promoted, it becomes a readable and writable cluster.

## Check cluster replication role and replication region

To check replication role of a cluster, follow these steps:
1. Select an existing Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.
1. Select **Overview** page.
1. Check **Read region** (on the primary cluster) or **Write region** (on the replica cluster) value.

If **Read region** value is *Not enabled*, this cluster has cross-region replication disabled.

## Disable cross-region replication

To disable cross-region replication, follow these steps:

1. Select the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore *replica* cluster.
1. Select **Overview**.
1. [Confirm that it's a replica cluster](#check-cluster-replication-role-and-replication-region).
1. In the Azure portal, on the **Overview** page for the replica cluster, select **Delete**.
1. On the **Delete \<replica name>** screen, read the warning text, and enter cluster's name in the **Confirm the account name** field.
1. Select **Delete** to confirm deletion of the replica.

If you need to delete the primary and replica clusters, you would need to delete the replica cluster first.

## Use connection strings

You can connect to the cluster replica as you would to a regular read-write cluster. When global distribution is enabled on the cluster, you can use global read-write connection string for reads and writes. This global read-write connection string would always point to the current read-write cluster.
Follow these steps to [get the connection strings for different cases](./cross-region-replication.md#read-operations-on-cluster-replicas-and-connection-strings):

1. Select the primary cluster or its cluster replica in the portal.
1. On the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Connection strings**.
1. On the primary cluster, copy the global read-write connection string for connections to the current read-write cluster. 
1. Copy the connection string for currently selected cluster to connect to that cluster as you would with a regular read-write cluster.

Connection strings are preserved after [the cluster replica promotion](./cross-region-replication.md#replica-cluster-promotion).
