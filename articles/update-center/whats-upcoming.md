# What are the upcoming features in Azure Update Manager

The article [What's new in Azure Update Manager](whats-new.md) contains updates of feature releases. This article lists all the upcoming features for Azure Update Manager.

Expanded support for [specialized images](../virtual-machines/linux/imaging.md#specialized-images), virtual machines created by Azure Migrate, Azure Backup, and Azure Site Recovery, and Azure Marketplace images are upcoming in the third quarter of 2023.
