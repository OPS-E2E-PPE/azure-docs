# Use the newer metric alerts for Azure services in Azure portal
Azure Monitor supports a new alert type called near real-time metric alerts. 

Near real-time metric alerts differ from [classic metric alerts](insights-alerts-portal.md) in a few ways:

- **Improved latency**: Near real-time metric alerts can run as frequently as every one minute. Older metric alerts always run at a frequency of 5 minutes.
- **Support for multi-dimensional metrics**: You can alert on dimensional metrics allowing you to monitor an interesting segment of the metric.
- **More control over metric conditions**: You can define richer alert rules in near real-time metric alerts. The alerts support monitoring the maximum, minimum, average, and total values of metrics.
- **Combined monitoring of multiple metrics**: Near real-time metric alerts can monitor multiple metrics (currently, up to two metrics) with a single rule. An alert is triggered if both metrics breach their respective thresholds for the specified time period.
- **Modular notification system**: Near real-time metric alerts use [action groups](monitoring-action-groups.md). You can use action groups to create modular actions. You can reuse action groups for multiple alert rules.
- **Metrics from Logs**: From popular log data coming into [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md), metrics can be extracted into Azure Monitor and be alerted at near real-time basis.


## Metrics and Dimensions Supported
Near real-time metric alerts support alerting for metrics that use dimensions. You can use dimensions to filter your metric to the right level. All supported metrics along with applicable dimensions can be explored and visualized from [Azure Monitor - Metrics Explorer (Preview)](monitoring-metric-charts.md).

Here's the full list of Azure monitor based metric sources that are supported for near real-time metric alerts:

## Create a newer metric alert
Currently, you can create newer metric alerts only in the Azure portal or REST API. Support for configuring near real-time metric alerts by using PowerShell, the Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) is coming soon.

To learn how to create a newer metric alert in Azure portal, see [Create an alert rule in the Azure portal](monitor-alerts-unified-usage.md#create-an-alert-rule-with-the-azure-portal).

## Manage newer metric alerts
After you create a near real-time metric alert, you can manage the alert by using the steps described in [Manage your alerts in the Azure portal](monitor-alerts-unified-usage.md#managing-your-alerts-in-azure-portal).

## Support for OMS logs as metrics for alerting

You can also use near real-time metric alerts on popular OMS logs extracted as metrics as part of Metrics from Logs Preview.  
- [Performance counters](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md) for Windows & Linux machines
- Heartbeat records for machines
- [Update management](../operations-management-suite/oms-solution-update-management.md) records

Here's the full list of OMS log based metric sources that are supported for near real-time metric alerts:
