# Near real-time metric alerts (preview)
Azure Monitor supports a new alert type called near real-time metric alerts (preview). This feature currently is in public preview.

Near real-time metric alerts differ from regular metric alerts in a few ways:

- **Improved latency**: Near real-time metric alerts can monitor changes in metric values with a frequency as small as one minute.
- **More control over metric conditions**: You can define richer alert rules in near real-time metric alerts. The alerts support monitoring the maximum, minimum, average, and total values of metrics.
- **Metrics from Logs**: From popular log data coming into [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md), metrics can be extracted into Azure Monitor and be alerted at near real-time basis
- **Combined monitoring of multiple metrics**: Near real-time metric alerts can monitor multiple metrics (currently, up to two metrics) with a single rule. An alert is triggered if both metrics breach their respective thresholds for the specified time period.
- **Modular notification system**: Near real-time metric alerts use [action groups](monitoring-action-groups.md). You can use action groups to create modular actions. You can reuse action groups for multiple alert rules.

> [!NOTE]
> The near real-time metric alert is currently is in public preview. And metrics from logs features are in *limited* public preview. The functionality and user experience is subject to change.

## Metrics and Dimensions Supported
Near real-time metric alerts support alerting for metrics that use dimensions. You can use dimensions to filter your metric to the right level. All supported metrics along with applicable dimensions can be explored and visualized from [Azure Monitor - Metrics Explorer (Preview)](monitoring-metric-charts.md).

Here's the full list of Azure monitor based metric sources that are supported for near real-time metric alerts:

- [Performance counters](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md) for Windows & Linux machines
- Heartbeat records for machines
- [Update management](../operations-management-suite/oms-solution-update-management.md) records

## Create a near real-time metric alert
Currently, you can create near real-time metric alerts only in the Azure portal. Support for configuring near real-time metric alerts by using PowerShell, the Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI), and Azure Monitor REST APIs is coming soon.

The experience for creating a near real-time metric alert has moved to the new **Alerts (Preview)** page. Even if the current alerts page displays **Add Near Real-Time Metric alert**, you are redirected to the **Alerts (Preview)** page.

To learn how to create a near real-time metric alert, see [Create an alert rule in the Azure portal](monitor-alerts-unified-usage.md#create-an-alert-rule-with-the-azure-portal).

## Manage near real-time metric alerts
After you create a near real-time metric alert, you can manage the alert by using the steps described in [Manage your alerts in the Azure portal](monitor-alerts-unified-usage.md#managing-your-alerts-in-azure-portal).

## Payload schema

The POST operation contains the following JSON payload and schema for all near real-time metric alerts when appropriately configured [action group](monitoring-action-groups.md) is used:

```json
