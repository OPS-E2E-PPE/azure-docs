# Connect to a VM using Bastion and a Linux native client

This article helps you connect to a VM in the VNet using the native client (SSH or RDP) on your local computer using the **az network bastion tunnel** command. The native client feature lets you connect to your target VMs via Bastion using Azure CLI, and expands your sign-in options to include local SSH key pair and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). For more information and steps to configure Bastion for native client connections, see [Configure Bastion for native client connections](native-client.md). Connections via native client require the Bastion Standard SKU.

After you've configured Bastion for native client support, you can connect to a VM using the **az network bastion tunnel** command. When you use this command, you can do the following:

  * Use native clients on *non*-Windows local computers (example: a Linux computer).
  * Use the native client of your choice. (This includes the Windows native client.)
  * Connect using SSH or RDP. (The bastion tunnel doesn't relay web servers or hosts.)
  * Set up concurrent VM sessions with Bastion.
  * [Upload files](vm-upload-download-native.md#tunnel-command) to your target VM from your local computer. File download from the target VM to the local client is currently not supported for this command.

Limitations:

* Signing in using an SSH private key stored in Azure Key Vault isnâ€™t supported with this feature. Before signing in to your Linux VM using an SSH key pair, download your private key to a file on your local machine.
* This feature isn't supported on Cloud Shell.

## <a name="prereq"></a>Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [VM connect prerequisites](../../includes/bastion-native-pre-vm-connect.md)]

## <a name="verify"></a>Verify roles and ports

Verify that the following roles and ports are configured in order to connect to the VM.

## <a name="connect-tunnel"></a>Connect to a VM

This section helps you connect to your virtual machine from native clients on *non*-Windows local computers (example: Linux) using the **az network bastion tunnel** command. You can also connect using this method from a Windows computer. This is helpful when you require an SSH connection and want to upload files to your VM. The bastion tunnel supports RDP/SSH connection, but doesn't relay web servers or hosts.

This connection supports file upload from the local computer to the target VM. For more information, see [Upload files](vm-upload-download-native.md).

## <a name="connect-IP"></a>Connect to VM via IP Address

[!INCLUDE [IP address](../../includes/bastion-native-ip-address.md)]

Use the following command as an example:
   
   **Tunnel:**
   
   ```azurecli
   az network bastion tunnel --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>" --resource-port "<TargetVMPort>" --port "<LocalMachinePort>"
   ```
