# Deploy Events in the Azure portal

In this quickstart, you’ll learn how to deploy the Azure Health Data Services Events feature in the Azure portal to send Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) event messages.

## Prerequisites

It's important that you have the following prerequisites completed before you begin the steps of deploying the Events feature in Azure Health Data Services.

* [An active Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/search/?OCID=AID2100131_SEM_c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc:G:s&ef_id=c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc:G:s&msclkid=c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc)
* [Event Hubs namespace and an event hub deployed in the Azure portal](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md)
* [Workspace deployed in Azure Health Data Services](../healthcare-apis-quickstart.md)  
* [FHIR service deployed in Azure Health Data Services](../fhir/fhir-portal-quickstart.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of this quickstart, we'll be using a basic set up and an event hub as the endpoint for Events messages.

## Deploy Events 

1. Browse to the Workspace that contains the FHIR service you want to send event messages from and select the **Events** blade.

2. Select **+ Event Subscription** to begin the creation of an event subscription.

3. In the **Create Event Subscription** box, enter the following subscription information.

    * **Name**: Provide a name for your Events subscription.
    * **Event types**: Type of FHIR events to send messages for (for example: create, updated, and deleted).
    * **Endpoint Details**: Endpoint to send Events messages to (for example: an Event Hubs).

   >[!NOTE]
   > For the purposes of this quickstart, we'll use the **Event Schema** and the **Managed Identity Type** settings as their defaults.

4. After the form is completed, select **Create** to begin the subscription creation. 

5. After provisioning a new Events subscription, event messages won't be sent until the System Topic deployment has successfully completed and the status of the Workspace has changed from "Updating" to "Succeeded".

   :::image type="content" source="media/events-deploy-in-portal/events-workspace-update.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an events subscription successfully deployed."  lightbox="media/events-deploy-in-portal/events-workspace-update.png":::


6. After the subscription is deployed, it will require access to your message delivery endpoint.
