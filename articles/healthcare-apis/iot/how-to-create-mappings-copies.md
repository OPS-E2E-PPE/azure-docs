# How to create copies of device and FHIR destination mappings

This article provides steps for creating copies of your MedTech service's device and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) destination mappings that can be used outside of Azure. These copies can be used for editing, troubleshooting, and archiving.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting MedTech service device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to the MedTech service in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of the MedTech service.

> [!NOTE]
> When opening an [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for the MedTech service, include copies of your device and FHIR destination mappings to assist in the troubleshooting process.

## Copy creation process

1. Select **"MedTech service"** on the left side of the Azure Health Data Services workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/iot-connector-blade.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select MedTech service." lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/iot-connector-blade.png":::

2. Select the name of the **MedTech service** that you'll be copying the device and FHIR destination mappings from.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This process may also be used for copying and saving the contents of the **"Destination"** FHIR destination mapping.

3. Select the contents of the JSON and do a copy operation (for example: Press **Ctrl + C**).

4. Do a paste operation (for example: Press **Ctrl + V**) into a new file within an editor like Microsoft Visual Studio Code or Notepad. Make sure to save the file with the **.json** extension.
