# Frequently asked questions about the MedTech service

Here are some of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the MedTech service.

## The MedTech service: The basics

### Where is the MedTech service available?

The MedTech service is available in these Azure regions: [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=health-data-services).

### Can I use the MedTech service with a different FHIR service other than the Azure Health Data Services FHIR service?

No. The Azure Health Data Services MedTech service currently only supports the Azure Health Data Services Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) service for the persistence of data. The open-source version of the MedTech service supports the use of different FHIR services. 

To learn more about the MedTech service open-source projects, see [Open-source projects](git-projects.md). 

### What versions of FHIR does the MedTech service support?

The MedTech service currently only supports the persistence of [HL7 FHIR&#174; R4](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=491). 

### Does the MedTech service perform backups of device messages?

No. The MedTech service doesn't back up the device messages that come into the customer's event hub. The customer controls the device message retention period within their event hub, which can be from 1-7 days. If the device message data is successfully processed by the MedTech service, it's persisted in the FHIR service, and the FHIR service backup policy applies. 

To learn more about event hub message retention, see [What is the maximum retention period for events?](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-faq#what-is-the-maximum-retention-period-for-events-) 

### What are the subscription quota limits for the MedTech service?

* 25 MedTech services per Subscription (not adjustable)
* 10 MedTech services per workspace (not adjustable)
* One FHIR destination* per MedTech service (not adjustable)

(* - FHIR Destination is a child resource of the MedTech service)

### Can I use the MedTech service with device messages from Apple&#174;, Google&#174;, or Fitbit&#174; devices?

Yes. The MedTech service supports device messages from all these vendors through the open-source version of the MedTech service. 

To learn more about the MedTech service open-source projects, see [Open-source projects](git-projects.md).
