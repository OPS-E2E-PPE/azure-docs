# Use API portal

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article shows you how to use the API portal with Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise Tier.

[API portal](https://docs.vmware.com/en/API-portal-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/api-portal/GUID-index.html) is one of the commercial VMware Tanzu components. API portal supports viewing API definitions from [Spring Cloud Gateway](./how-to-use-enterprise-spring-cloud-gateway.md) and testing of specific API routes from the browser. It also supports enabling Single Sign-On authentication via configuration.

## Prerequisites

- An already provisioned Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise tier instance with API portal enabled. For more information, see [Quickstart: Provision an Azure Spring Cloud service instance using the Enterprise tier](quickstart-provision-service-instance-enterprise.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > To use API portal, you must enable it when you provision your Azure Spring Cloud service instance. You cannot enable it after provisioning at this time.

- [Spring Cloud Gateway](./how-to-use-enterprise-spring-cloud-gateway.md) is enabled during provisioning and the corresponding API metadata is configured.

## Configure the API portal

The following sections describe configuration in the API portal.

### Configure single sign-on (SSO)

The API portal supports authentication and authorization using single sign-on (SSO) with an OpenID identity provider (IdP) that supports the OpenID Connect Discovery protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> Only authorization servers supporting the OpenID Connect Discovery protocol are supported. Be sure to configure the external authorization server to allow redirects back to the gateway. Refer to your authorization server's documentation and add `https://<gateway-external-url>/login/oauth2/code/sso` to the list of allowed redirect URIs.

| Property | Required? | Description |
| - | - | - |
| issuerUri | Yes | The URI that the it asserts as its Issuer Identifier. For example, if the issuer-uri provided is "https://example.com", then an OpenID Provider Configuration Request will be made to "https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration". The result is expected to be an OpenID Provider Configuration Response. |
| clientId | Yes | The OpenID Connect client ID provided by your IdP |
| clientSecret | Yes | The OpenID Connect client secret provided by your IdP |
| scope | Yes | A list of scopes to include in JWT identity tokens. This list should be based on the scopes allowed by your identity provider |

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure the wrong SSO property, such as the wrong password, you should remove the entire SSO property and re-add the correct configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using the SSO feature, only one instance count is supported.

### Configure the instance count

Configuration of the instance count for the API portal is supported, unless you are using SSO. If you are using the SSO feature, only one instance count is supported.

## Assign a public endpoint for the API portal

To access the API portal, use the following steps to assign a public endpoint:

1. Select **API portal**.
1. Select **Overview** to view the running state and resources allocated to the API portal.
1. Select **Yes** next to *Assign endpoint* to assign a public endpoint. A URL will be generated within a few minutes.
1. Save the URL for use later.

You can also use the Azure CLI to assign a public endpoint with the following command:

```azurecli
az spring-cloud api-portal update --assign-endpoint
```

## View the route information through the API portal

> [!NOTE]
> It takes several minutes to sync between Spring Cloud Gateway and the API portal.

Select the `endpoint URL` to go to API portal. You'll see all the routes configured in Spring Cloud Gateway.
