# Create Azure Spring Cloud instance with availability zone enabled


**This article applies to:** ✔️ Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not available in Basic tier.

This article explains availability zones in Azure Spring Cloud, and how to enable them.

In Microsoft Azure, [Availability Zones (AZ)](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more data centers that are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Availability zones protect your applications and data from data center failures.

When an Azure Spring Cloud service instance is created with availability zone enabled, Azure Spring Cloud will automatically distribute fundamental resources across logical sections of underlying Azure infrastructure. This distribution provides a higher level of availability to protect against a hardware failure or a planned maintenance event.

## How to create an instance in Azure Spring Cloud with availability zone enabled

>[!NOTE]
> You can only enable availability zone when creating your instance. You can't enable or disable availability zone after creation of the service instance.

You can enable availability zone in Azure Spring Cloud using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To create a service in Azure Spring Cloud with availability zone enabled using the Azure CLI, include the `--zone-redundant` parameter when you create your service in Azure Spring Cloud.

```azurecli
az spring-cloud create \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --name <your-Azure-Spring-Cloud-instance-name> \
    --location <location> \
    --zone-redundant true
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To create a service in Azure Spring Cloud with availability zone enabled using the Azure portal, enable the Zone Redundant option when creating the instance.
