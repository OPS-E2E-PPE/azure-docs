# Quickstart: Create a Private Link service using the Azure portal

Azure Private Link service is the reference to your own service that is powered by Azure Private Link. The service or resource that is operating behind Azure Load Balancer can be enabled for Private Link access. Consumers of your service can access the service privately from their own VNets. In this Quickstart, you'll learn how to create a private link service using the Azure portal.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.


## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Create an Internal load balancer

First, create a virtual network, then an internal load balancer to use with the Azure Private Link service.

### Create the virtual network

In this section, you'll create a Virtual Network and the subnet to host the load balancer that is used to access your Private Link service.


1. On the upper-left side of the portal, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Virtual network**.
   
1. In the **Create virtual network** pane, type or select these values:
   
   - **Name**: Type **MyVNet**.
   - **ResourceGroup**: Select **Create new**, then enter **MyResourceGroupLB**, and select **OK**. 
   - **Subnet** > **Name**: Type **MyBackendSubnet**.
   
1. Select **Create**.

### Create a Standard load balancer

Create a standard internal load balancer by using the portal. The name and IP address you create are automatically configured as the load balancer's front end.

1. On the upper-left side of the portal, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Load Balancer**.
   
2. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create load balancer** page, enter or select the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Review + create**:

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Subscription               | Select your subscription.    |    
    | Resource group         | Select *MyResourceGroupLB* in the pull-down box.|
    | Name                   | *myLoadBalancer*                                   |
    | Region         | Select **East US 2**.                                        |
    | Type          | Select **Internal**.                                        |
    | SKU           | Select **Standard**.                          |
    | Virtual network           | Select *MyVNet*.                          |    
    | IP address assignment              | Select **Static**.   |
    | Private IP address|Type an address that is in the address space of your virtual network and subnet, for example *10.3.0.7*.  |

3. In the **Review + create** tab, click **Create**. 
   

### Create Standard load balancer resources

In this section, you configure load balancer settings for a back-end address pool and a health probe, and specify load balancer rules.

#### Create a Backend pool

To distribute traffic to your resources, a backend address pool contains the IP addresses of the virtual (NICs) connected to the Load Balancer. Create the backend address pool *myBackendPool* to include resources for load-balancing traffic.

1. Select **All services** in the left-hand menu, select **All resources**, and then select **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Backend pools**, then select **Add**.
3. On the **Add a backend pool** page, for name, type *myBackendPool*, as the name for your backend pool, and then select **Add**.



#### Create a health probe

To allow the load balancer to monitor resource status, you use a health probe. The health probe dynamically adds or removes resources from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks. 

**To create a health probe to monitor the health of the resources:**

1. Select **All resources** on the left menu, and then select **MyLoadBalancer** from the resource list.
   
1. Under **Settings**, select **Health probes**, and then select **Add**.
   
1. On the **Add a health probe** page, type or select the following values:
   
   - **Name**: Type **MyHealthProbe**.
   - **Protocol**: Drop down and select **TCP**. 
   - **Port**: Type **80**. 
   - **Interval**: Type **15**. Interval is the number of seconds between probe attempts.
   - **Unhealthy threshold**: Type **2**. This value is the number of consecutive probe failures that occur before a VM is considered unhealthy.
   
1. Select **OK**.

#### Create a load balancer rule

A load balancer rule defines how traffic is distributed to resources. The rule defines the front-end IP configuration for incoming traffic, the back-end IP pool to receive the traffic, and the required source and destination ports. 

The load balancer rule named **MyLoadBalancerRule** listens to port 80 in the front-end **LoadBalancerFrontEnd**. The rule sends network traffic to the back-end address pool **MyBackendPool**, also on port 80. 

**To create the load balancer rule:**

1. Select **All resources** on the left menu, and then select **MyLoadBalancer** from the resource list.
   
1. Under **Settings**, select **Load-balancing rules**, and then select **Add**.
   
1. On the **Add load-balancing rule** page, type or select the following values, if not already present:
   
   - **Name**: Type **MyLoadBalancerRule**.
   - **Frontend IP address:** Type **LoadBalancerFrontEnd** if not present.
   - **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
   - **Port**: Type **80**.
   - **Backend port**: Type **80**.
   - **Backend pool**: Select **MyBackendPool**.
   - **Health probe**: Select **MyHealthProbe**. 
   
1. Select **OK**.
   
## Create a private link service

In this section, you will create a private link service behind a standard load balancer.

1. On the upper-left side of the screen in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Private Link Center (Preview)**. You can also search Private Link through portal search.

2. In **Private Link Center - Overview**, on the option to **"Expose your own service so others can connect"** select Start.

3. Enter myResourceGroup for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created an internal Azure load balancer and a private link service. To learn more about how to create private endpoints, see [Create Private Endpoints using Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal).
