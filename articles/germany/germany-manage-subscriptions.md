# Manage and connect to your subscription in Azure Germany
Azure Germany has unique URLs and endpoints for managing your environment. It's important to use the right connections to manage your environment through the Azure portal or PowerShell. After you connect to the Azure Germany environment, the normal operations for managing a service work if the component has been deployed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>This applies to Azure customers in Microsoft Cloud Germany who purchase Azure services directly from Microsoft with pay-as-you-go pricing and pay by credit card. 
>
>Effective September 14, 2019, a new European Union mandate takes effect that requires customer credit card payments to go through a strong customer authentication (SCA) challenge. As a result, impacted customers will be unable to create a new subscription or add or update payment information, until they [migrate to a new Azure region](./germany-migration-main.md). 
>
>**Action required:**
>
>If you are affected by the European Union mandate, you need to update your payment instrument and create any new subscriptions by September 14, 2019. You can update your credit card information or switch to invoice pay in the [Account center](https://account.windowsazure.de). From the portal, select the subscription you’d like to change the payment method of, then click ‘Manage payment methods’. If you want to switch to invoice pay but don't see it as an option, please contact support. After September 14th, you will not be able to update your payment instrument.
