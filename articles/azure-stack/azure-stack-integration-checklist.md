# Azure Stack datacenter integration checklist
To ensure the deployment and integration of the Azure Stack solution is a success, itâ€™s recommended to follow these three checklists.

## Pre-Onsite Checklist 
[  ] Prepare for deployment with all software required for the install, that includes: 
  - Azure Stack build 
  - Windows Server 2016 Evaluation ISO 
  - Partner Toolkit 
  - OEM Extensions 
  - Any software and tools to install on the HLH based on OEM 

[  ] Work with OEM to complete the deployment worksheet and send the exported JSON files. 

[  ] Review PKI certificate requirements and if possible validate the certificates. 

[  ] Review Azure AD Account requirements (install, registration and tenant test (Canary)). 

[  ] After reading and understanding the physical infrastructure, ensure that the border device supports Layer 3 configuration on the physical interfaces and that routing is configured for either BGP or Static routing. 

[  ] Ensure the datacenter network is configured, routing and firewall are ready, and these IPs have internet access: public VIPs, Azure Stack infrastructure and DVM IP (these last two may require NAT for outbound Internet access). 

[  ] Review datacenter requirements like power, location, measurements, and weight limits. 

## Pre-Deployment Checklist 
[  ] Ensure that the border device is ready with Layer 3 configuration on the physical interfaces and that routing is configured for either BGP or Static routing.

[  ] Verify the datacenter network is configured, routing and firewall are ready, and these IPs have internet access: public VIPs, Azure Stack infrastructure and DVM IP (these last two should require NAT for outbound Internet access). 

[  ] Prepare the switches, the HLH and the nodes for deployment. 

[  ] Validate network connectivity and external access to required resources. 

[  ] Perform PKI certificate validation. 

## Post-Deployment Checklist 
[  ] Install all current update packages. 

[  ] Run and pass final verification tests. 

[  ] Complete Azure Stack Registration 

[  ] Integrate DNS 

[  ] Remove DVM
