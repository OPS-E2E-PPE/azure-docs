# Prepare Azure Stack PKI certificates for deployment
The certificate files [obtained from your CA of choice](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) must be imported and exported with properties matching Azure Stack’s certificate requirements.


## Prepare certificates for deployment
Use these steps to prepare and validate the Azure Stack PKI certificates: 

1.	Copy the original certificate versions [obtained from your CA of choice](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) into a directory on the deployment host. 
  > [!WARNING]
  > Do not copy files that have already been imported, exported, or altered in any way from the files provided directly by the CA.

2.	Import the certificates onto the Local Machine certificate store:

    a.	Right-click on the certificate and select **Install PFX**.

    b.	In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, select **Local Machine** as the import location. Select **Next**.

    c.	Select **Next** on the **Choose file to import** page.

    d.	On the **Private key protection** page, enter the password for your certificate files and then enable the **Mark this key as exportable. This allows you to back up or transport your keys at a later time** option. Select **Next**.

  f.	Click **Finish** to complete the Certificate Import Wizard.

  g.	Repeat the process for all certificates you are providing for your deployment.

3. Export the Certificate to PFX file format with Azure Stack’s requirements:

  a.	Open Certificate Manager MMC console and connect to the Local Machine certificate store.

  b.	Go to the **Enterprise Trust** directory.

  c.	Select one of the certificates you imported in step 2 above.

  d.	From the task bar of Certificate Manager console, select **Actions** > **All Tasks** > **Export**.

  e.	Select **Next**.

  f.	Select **Yes, Export the Private Key**, and then click **Next**.

  g.	In the Export File Format section, select **Export all Extended Properties** and then click **Next**.

  h.	Select **Password** and provide a password for the certificates. Remember this password as it is used as a deployment parameter. Select **Next**.

  i.	Choose a file name and location for the pfx file to export. Select **Next**.

  j.	Select **Finish**.

  k.	Repeat this process for all of the certificates you imported for your deployment in step 2 above.
