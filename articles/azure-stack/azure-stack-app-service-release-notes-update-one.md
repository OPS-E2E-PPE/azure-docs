## Build reference

The App Service on Azure Stack Update 1 build number is **69.0.13698.9**

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure App Service on Azure Stack now requires a [three-subject wildcard certificate](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#get-certificates) due to improvements in the way in which SSO for Kudu is now handled in Azure App Service.

>
>

### New features and fixes

Azure App Service on Azure Stack Update 1 includes the following improvements and fixes:

- **High Availability of Azure App Service** - The Azure Stack 1802 update enabled workloads to be deployed across fault domains.

By default all new deployments of Azure App Service will have this capability however for deployments completed prior to Azure Stack 1802 update being applied refer to the [App Service Fault Domain documentation](azure-stack-app-service-fault-domain-update.md)

- **Deploy in existing virtual network** - Customers can now deploy App Service on Azure Stack within an existing virtual network.  Deploying in an existing virtual network enables customers to connect to the SQL Server and File Server, required for Azure App Service, over private ports.  During deployment customers can select to deploy in an existing virtual network, however [must create subnets for use by App Service](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#virtual-network) prior to deployment.
