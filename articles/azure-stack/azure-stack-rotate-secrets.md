# Rotate secrets in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

Update your passwords for Azure Stack components at a regular cadence.

## Updating the passwords for the baseboard management controller (BMC)

The baseboard management controllers (BMC) monitor the physical state of your servers. The specifications and instructions on updating the password of the BMC vary based on your original equipment manufacturer (OEM) hardware vendor.

1. Update the BMC on the Azure Stackâ€™s physical servers by following your OEM instructions. The password for each BMC in your environment must be the same.
2. Open a privileged endpoint in Azure Stack Sessions. For instruction, see [Using the privileged endpoint in Azure Stack](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md).
3. After your PowerShell prompt has changed to **[IP address or ERCS VM name]: PS>** or to **[azs-ercs01]: PS>**, depending on the environment, run `Set-BmcPassword` by running `invoke-command`. Pass your privileged endpoint session variable as a parameter.  
For example:
    ```powershell
    $PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName <ERCS computer name> -Credential <CloudAdmin credential> -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint"  
    
    Invoke-Command -Session $PEPSession -ScriptBlock {
        param($password)
        set-bmcpassword -bmcpassword $password
    } -ArgumentList (<LatestPassword as a SecureString>) 
    ```
