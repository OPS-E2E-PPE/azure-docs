# Register Azure Stack with Azure
Registering [Azure Stack](azure-stack-poc.md) with Azure allows you to download marketplace items from Azure and to set up commerce data reporting back to Microsoft. After you register Azure Stack, usage is reported to Azure commerce and you can see it under the subscription used for registration. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Registration is mandatory if you choose the pay-as-you-use billing model. Otherwise, you will be in violation of the licensing terms of the Azure Stack deployment as usage will otherwise not be reported.

## Prerequisites
Before registering Azure Stack with Azure, you must have:

- The subscription ID for an Azure subscription. To get the ID, sign in to Azure, click **More services** > **Subscriptions**, click the subscription you want to use, and under **Essentials** you can find the Subscription ID. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > China, Germany, and US Government cloud subscriptions are not currently supported. 

- The username and password for an account that is an owner for the subscription (MSA/2FA accounts are supported)
- Registered the Azure Stack resource provider (see the Register Azure Stack Resource Provider section below for details).

If you don’t have an Azure subscription that meets these requirements, you can [create a free Azure account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?b=17.06). Registering Azure Stack incurs no cost on your Azure subscription.

### <a name="bkmk_powershell"></a>Install PowerShell for Azure Stack
You need to use the latest PowerShell for Azure Stack to register with Azure.

If not already installed, [install PowerShell for Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-powershell-install). 

### <a name="bkmk_tools"></a>Download the Azure Stack tools
The Azure Stack tools GitHub repository contains PowerShell modules that support Azure Stack functionality; including registration functionality. During the registration process you will need to import and use the RegisterWithAzure.psm1 PowerShell module, found in the Azure Stack tools repository, to register your Azure Stack instance with Azure. 

To ensure you are using the latest version, you should delete any existing versions of the Azure Stack tools and [download the latest version from GitHub](azure-stack-powershell-download.md) before registering with Azure.

## Register Azure Stack in connected environments
Connected environments can access the internet and Azure. For these environments, you need to register the Azure Stack resource provider with Azure and then configure your billing model.

> [!NOTE]
> All these steps must be run from a computer that has access to the privileged endpoint. 

### Register the Azure Stack resource provider
To register the Azure Stack resource provider with Azure, start Powershell ISE as an administrator and use the following PowerShell commands. These commands will:
- Prompt you to log in as an owner of the Azure subscription to be used and set the `EnvironmentName` parameter to **AzureCloud**.
- Register the Azure resource provider **Microsoft.AzureStack**.

1. Add the Azure account that you use to register Azure Stack. To add the account, run the **Add-AzureRmAccount** cmdlet. You are prompted to enter your Azure global administrator account credentials and you may have to use 2-factor authentication based on your account’s configuration.

   ```Powershell
      Add-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureCloud
   ```

2. If you have multiple subscriptions, run the following command to select the one you want to use:  

   ```powershell
      Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionID '<Your Azure Subscription GUID>' | Select-AzureRmSubscription
   ```

3. Run the following command to register the Azure Stack resource provider in your Azure subscription:

   ```Powershell
   Register-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AzureStack
   ```

### Register Azure Stack with Azure using the pay-as-you-use billing model
Use the these steps to register Azure Stack with Azure using the pay-as-you-use billing model.

Start PowerShell ISE as an administrator and navigate to the **Registration** folder in the **AzureStack-Tools-master** directory created when you [downloaded the Azure Stack tools](#bkmk_tools). Import the **RegisterWithAzure.psm1** module using PowerShell: 

PowerShell to run:

```powershell
Import-Module .\RegisterWithAzure.psm1
```
Next, in the same PowerShell session, run the **Set-AzsRegistration** cmdlet. When prompted for credentials, specify the owner of the Azure subscription.  

PowerShell to run:

```powershell
$AzureContext = Get-AzureRmContext
$CloudAdminCred = Get-Credential -UserName <Azure subscription owner>  -Message "Enter the cloud domain credentials to access the privileged endpoint"
Set-AzsRegistration `
    -CloudAdminCredential $CloudAdminCred `
    -PrivilegedEndpoint <PrivilegedEndPoint computer name> `
    -BillingModel PayAsYouUse
```

|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|CloudAdminCredential|PowerShell object that contains credential information (username and password) for the owner of the Azure subscription.|
|PrivilegedEndpoint|A pre-configured remote PowerShell console that provides you with capabilities like log collection and other post deployment tasks. To learn more, refer to the [using the privileged endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-privileged-endpoint#access-the-privileged-endpoint) article.|
|BillingModel|The billing model that your subscription uses. Allowed values for this parameter are: Capacity, PayAsYouUse, and Development.|

### Register Azure Stack with Azure using the capacity billing model
Follow the same instructions used for registering using the pay-as-you-use billing model, but add the agreement number under which capacity was purchased and change the `BillingModel` parameter to **Capacity**. All other parameters are unchanged.

PowerShell to run:
```powershell
$AzureContext = Get-AzureRmContext
$CloudAdminCred = Get-Credential -UserName <Azure subscription owner>  -Message "Enter the cloud domain credentials to access the privileged endpoint"
Set-AzsRegistration `
    -CloudAdminCredential $CloudAdminCred `
    -PrivilegedEndpoint <PrivilegedEndPoint computer name> `
    -AgreementNumber <EA agreement number> `
    -BillingModel Capacity
```

## Register Azure Stack in disconnected environments 
*The information in this section applies beginning with the Azure Stack 1712 update version (180106.1) and is not supported with earlier versions.*

If you are registering Azure Stack in a disconnected environment (with no internet connectivity), you need to get a registration token from the Azure Stack environment and then use that token on a computer that can connect to Azure and has [PowerShell for Azure Stack installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-powershell-install).  

### Get a registration token from the Azure Stack environment
  1. To get the registration token, run the following PowerShell commands:  

     ```Powershell
        $FilePathForRegistrationToken = $env:SystemDrive\RegistrationToken.txt
        $RegistrationToken = Get-AzsRegistrationToken -CloudAdminCredential $YourCloudAdminCredential -PrivilegedEndpoint $YourPrivilegedEndpoint -BillingModel Capacity -AgreementNumber '<your agreement number>' -TokenOutputFilePath $FilePathForRegistrationToken
      ```
      > [!TIP]  
      > The registration token is saved in the file specified for *$env:SystemDrive\RegistrationToken.txt*.

  2. Save this registration token for use on the Azure connected machine.


### Connect to Azure and register
Start PowerShell ISE as an administrator and navigate to the **Registration** folder in the **AzureStack-Tools-master** directory created when you [downloaded the Azure Stack tools](#bkmk_tools). Import the **RegisterWithAzure.psm1** module: 

PowerShell to run:
```powershell
Import-Module .\RegisterWithAzure.psm1
```
Next, in the same PowerShell session, specify the registration token to register with Azure:

```Powershell  
$registrationToken = "<Your Registration Token>"
Register-AzsEnvironment -RegistrationToken $registrationToken  
```
Optionally, you can use the Get-Content cmdlet to point to a file that contains your registration token:

 ```Powershell  
 $registrationToken = Get-Content -Path '<Path>\<Registration Token File>'
 Register-AzsEnvironment -RegistrationToken $registrationToken  
 ```
> [!NOTE]  
> Save the registration resource name or the registration token for future reference.

## Verify Azure Stack registration
Use these steps to verify that Azure Stack has successfully registered with Azure.
1. Sign in to the Azure Stack [administrator portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-manage-portals#access-the-administrator-portal): https&#58;//adminportal.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*.
2. Click **More Services** > **Marketplace Management** > **Add from Azure**.

If you see a list of items available from Azure (such as WordPress), your activation was successful.

> [!NOTE]
> After registration is complete, the active warning for not registering will no longer appear.

## Renew or change registration
You’ll need to update or renew your registration in the following circumstances:
- After you renew your capacity-based yearly subscription.
- When you change your billing model.
- When you scale changes (add/remove nodes) for capacity-based billing.

### Change the subscription you use
If you would like to change the subscription you use, you must first run the **Remove-AzsRegistration** cmdlet, then ensure you are logged in to the correct Azure PowerShell context, and finally run **Set-AzsRegistration** with any changed parameters:

```powershell
Remove-AzsRegistration -CloudAdminCredential $YourCloudAdminCredential -PrivilegedEndpoint $YourPrivilegedEndpoint
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId $NewSubscriptionId
Set-AzsRegistration -CloudAdminCredential $YourCloudAdminCredential -PrivilegedEndpoint $YourPrivilegedEndpoint -BillingModel PayAsYouUse
```

### Change the billing model or syndication features
If you would like to change the billing model or syndication features for your installation, you can call the registration function to set the new values. You do not need to first remove the current registration: 

```powershell
Set-AzsRegistration -CloudAdminCredential $YourCloudAdminCredential -PrivilegedEndpoint $YourPrivilegedEndpoint -BillingModel PayAsYouUse
```
