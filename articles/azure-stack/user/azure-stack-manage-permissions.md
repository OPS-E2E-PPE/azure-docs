# Manage Role-Based Access Control

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Azure Stack uses role-based access control for each instance of a subscription, resource group, or service. An Azure Stack user can be assigned one or more roles. For example, User-A might have reader permissions to Subscription-1, and have owner permissions to Virtual Machine-7.

## Built-in roles

Azure Stack has three basic roles that apply to all resource types:

* **Owner** can manage everything, including access to resources.
* **Contributor** can manage everything except access to resources.
* **Reader** can view everything, but canâ€™t make any changes.

## Set access permissions for a user

The following steps describe how to configure permissions for a user.

1. Sign in with an account that has owner permissions to the resource you want to manage.
2. In the blade for the resource, click the **Access** icon. <br>![Azure Stack Access Icon](media/azure-stack-manage-permissions/image1.png)

3. In the **Users** blade, click **Roles**.
4. In the **Roles** blade, click **Add** to add permissions for the user.
