# Azure Government Storage

## Azure Storage
Azure Storage is generally available in Azure Government.  For details on Azure Storage, see [Azure Storage public documentation](../storage/index.md).

### Storage pairing in Azure Government
The following map shows the primary and secondary region pairings used for Geo-redundant storage (GRS) and Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) accounts in Azure Government

![alt text](./media/documentation-government-services-storage.PNG)

> [!NOTE]
> USGov Virginia secondary region is USGov Texas. Previously, USGov Virginia utilized US Gov Iowa as a secondary region. Storage accounts with USGov Iowa as a secondary region are being migrated to USGov Texas as a secondary region.

### Checking secondary region for RA-GRS and GRS storage accounts
To view the current secondary region of your storage account through the Azure portal, click the storage account on the left. Click on the name of the storage account to bring up the storage account overview that lists the primary and secondary regions.

### Variations
The URLs for storage accounts in Azure Government are different:

| Service Type | Azure Public | Azure Government |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blob Storage |*.blob.core.windows.net |*.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net |
| Queue Storage |*.queue.core.windows.net |*.queue.core.usgovcloudapi.net |
| Table Storage |*.table.core.windows.net |*.table.core.usgovcloudapi.net |
| File Storage |*.file.core.windows.net |*.file.core.usgovcloudapi.net | 

> [!NOTE]
> All your scripts and code needs to account for the appropriate endpoints.  See [Configure Azure Storage Connection Strings](../storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string.md). 
>
>

For more information on APIs, see the [Cloud Storage Account Constructor](/dotnet/api/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.cloudstorageaccount.-ctor).

The endpoint suffix to use in these overloads is *core.usgovcloudapi.net*

> [!NOTE]
> If error 53 "The network path was not found." is returned, while [mounting the file share] (../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-files.md). It could be due to firewall blocking the outbound port. Try mounting the file share on VM that's in the same Azure Subscription as storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> When deploying StorSimple Manager Service, use https://portal.azure.us/ and https://manage.windowsazure.us/ URLs for Azure portal and Classic portal respectively. For deployment instructions for StorSimple Virtual Array, see [StorSimple Virtual Array system requirements] (../storsimple/storsimple-ova-system-requirements.md) and for StorSimple 8000 series, see [StorSimple software, high availability, and networking requirements] (../storsimple/storsimple-system-requirements.md) and go to Deploy section from left navigation. For more information on StorSimple, see the [StorSimple Documentation] (../storsimple/index.md).

### Considerations
The following information identifies the Azure Government boundary for Azure Storage:

| Regulated/controlled data permitted | Regulated/controlled data not permitted |
| --- | --- |
| Data entered, stored, and processed within an Azure Storage product may contain export-controlled data. Static authenticators, such as passwords and smartcard PINs for access to Azure platform components. Private keys of certificates used to manage Azure platform components. Other security information/secrets, such as certificates, encryption keys, master keys, and storage keys stored in Azure services. |Azure Storage metadata is not permitted to contain controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating and maintaining your storage product.  Do not enter regulated/controlled data into the following fields:  **Resource groups, Deployment names, Resource names, Resource tags**. |

## Azure Import/Export

Import/Export is generally available for Azure Government.  All Azure Government regions are supported.  To create Import/Export jobs, see the [Azure Import/Export documentation](../storage/storage-import-export-service.md).

### Variation

With Import/Export jobs for USGov Arizona or USGov Texas, the mailing address is for USGov Virginia.  The data is loaded into selected storage account from the USGov Virginia region.

### Consideration

For DoD L5 data, use a DoD region storage account to ensure that data is loaded directly into the DoD regions. 

For all jobs, it is recommended to rotate your storage account keys once the job is complete to remove any access granted during the process - [Managing storage account](../storage/common/storage-create-storage-account.md#manage-your-storage-access-keys)

| Regulated/controlled data permitted | Regulated/controlled data not permitted |
| --- | --- |
| Data copied to the media for transport and the keys used to encrypt that data. | Azure Import/Export metadata is not permitted to contain controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating your Import/Export job and shipping information used to transport your media.  Do not enter regulated/controlled data into the following fields:  **Job name, Carrier name, Tracking number, Description, Return information (Name, Address, Phone, E-Mail), Export Blob URI, Drive list, Package list, Storage account name, Container name**. |
