# Deploy to Azure App Services using Visual Studio 2017
This article describes how to deploy an Azure App Services app (API App, Web App, Mobile App) to Azure Government using Visual Studio 2017.

## Prerequisites
* See [Visual Studio prerequisites] (../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md#prerequisites) to install and configure Visual Studio 2017 and Azure SDK.
* Follow [these instructions] (documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-vs.md) to configure Visual Studio to connect to Azure Government account.

## Open App project in Visual Studio
If you have an existing app solution\project in Visual Studio, you can create a project by following [these instructions](../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md#create-an-aspnet-web-app).

Run the app in Visual Studio to make sure it works locally.

## Deploy to Azure Government
Once **Visual Studio is configured to connect to Azure Government account** (already done in prerequisites section), instructions to deploy to app services are exactly same as for Azure Public.

To deploy the app, follow [these steps] (../app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md#publish-to-azure).

Once the app has been successfully deployed to Azure Government, the url should end with "azurewebsites.us"(as shown below).
