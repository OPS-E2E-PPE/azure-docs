# Query your attack surface with Defender EASM using Microsoft Copilot for Azure

[Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM)](/azure/external-attack-surface-management/overview) scans inventory assets and collects robust contextual metadata that powers Attack Surface Insights. These insights help an organization understand what their attack surface looks like, where the risk resides, and what assets they need to focus on.

With Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview), you can use natural language to ask questions and better understand your organization's attack surface. Through Defender EASM's extensive querying capabilities, you can extract asset metadata and key asset information, even if you don't have an advanced Defender EASM querying skillset.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot for Azure about your attack surface, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context isn't clear, you'll be prompted to specify which Defender EASM resource to use.
