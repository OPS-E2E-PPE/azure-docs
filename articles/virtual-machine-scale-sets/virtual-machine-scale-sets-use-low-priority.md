# Low-priority VMs on scale sets (preview)

Using low-priority VMs on scale sets allows you to take advantage of our unutilized capacity at a significant cost savings. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict low-priority VMs. Therefore, low-priority VMs are great for workloads that can handle interruptions like batch processing jobs, dev/test environments, large compute workloads, and more.

The amount of available unutilized capacity can vary based on size, region, time of day, and more. When deploying low-priority VMs on scale sets, Azure will allocate the VMs if there is capacity available, but there is no SLA for these VMs. A low-priority scale set is deployed in a single fault domain and offers no high availability guarantees.

> [!NOTE]
> Low-priority scale sets are in preview and ready for your development and test scenarios. 

## Eviction Policy

When your low-priority scale set VMs are evicted, they will be moved to the Stopped (deallocated) state by default. With this eviction policy, you can redeploy evicted instances, but there is no guarantee that the allocation will succeed. The stopped VMs will count against your scale set instance quota and you will be charged for your underlying disks. 

If you would like your VMs in your low-priority scale set to be deleted when they are evicted, you can set the eviction policy to delete in your [Azure Resource Manager template](#use-azure-resource-manager-templates). With the eviction policy set to delete, you can create new VMs by increasing the scale set instance count property. The evicted VMs are deleted together with their underlying disks, and therefore you will not be charged for the storage. You can also use the auto-scaling feature of scale sets to automatically try and compensate for evicted VMs, however, there is no guarantee that the allocation will succeed. It is recommended you only use the auto-scale feature on low-priority scale sets when you set the eviction policy to delete to avoid the cost of your disks and hitting quota limits. 

> [!NOTE]
> During preview, you will be able to set your eviction policy by using [Azure Resource Manager templates](#use-azure-resource-manager-templates). 

## Deploying low-priority VMs on scale sets

To deploy low-priority VMs on scale sets, you can set the new *Priority* flag to *Low*. All VMs in your scale set will be set to low-priority. To create a scale set with low-priority VMs, use one of the following methods:
- [Azure CLI 2.0](#use-the-azure-cli-20)
- [Azure PowerShell](#use-azure-powershell)
- [Azure Resource Manager templates](#use-azure-resource-manager-templates)

## Use the Azure CLI 2.0

The process to create a scale set with low-priority VMs is the same as detailed in the [getting started article](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create-cli.md). Just add the '--Priority' parameter to the cli call and set it to *Low* as shown in the example below:

```azurecli
az vmss create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --upgrade-policy-mode automatic \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --priority Low
```

## Use Azure PowerShell

The process to create a scale set with low-priority VMs is the same as detailed in the [getting started article](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create-powershell.md).
Just add the '-Priority' parameter to the [New-AzureRmVmssConfig](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvmssconfig) and set it to *Low* as shown in the example below:

```powershell
$vmssConfig = New-AzureRmVmssConfig `
    -Location "East US 2" `
    -SkuCapacity 2 `
    -SkuName "Standard_DS2" `
    -UpgradePolicyMode Automatic `
    -Priority "Low"
```

## Use Azure Resource Manager Templates

The process to create a scale set that uses low-priority VMs is the same as detailed in the getting started article for [Linux](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create-template-linux.md) or [Windows](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create-template-windows.md). Add the 'priority' property to the *Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachineProfile* resource type in your template and specify *Low* as the value. Be sure to use *2017-10-30-preview* API version or higher. 

In order to set the eviction policy to deletion, add the 'evictionPolicy' parameter and set it to *delete*.

The following example creates a Linux low-priority scale set named *myScaleSet* in *West Central US*, which will *delete* the VMs in the scale set on eviction:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
  "name": "myScaleSet",
  "location": "East US 2",
  "apiVersion": "2017-12-01",
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_DS2_v2",
    "capacity": "2"
  },
  "properties": {
    "upgradePolicy": {
      "mode": "Automatic"
    },
    "virtualMachineProfile": {
       "priority": "Low",
       "evictionPolicy": "delete",
       "storageProfile": {
        "osDisk": {
          "caching": "ReadWrite",
          "createOption": "FromImage"
        },
        "imageReference":  {
          "publisher": "Canonical",
          "offer": "UbuntuServer",
          "sku": "16.04-LTS",
          "version": "latest"
        }
      },
      "osProfile": {
        "computerNamePrefix": "myvmss",
        "adminUsername": "azureuser",
        "adminPassword": "P@ssw0rd!"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Next steps
Now that you have created a scale set with low-priority VMs, try deploying our [auto scale template using low-priority](https://github.com/Azure/vm-scale-sets/tree/master/preview/lowpri).
