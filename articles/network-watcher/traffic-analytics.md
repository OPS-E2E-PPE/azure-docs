# Traffic Analytics

Traffic Analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks. Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. With traffic analytics, you can:

- Visualize network activity across your Azure subscriptions and identify hot spots.
- Identify security threats to, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting internet access, and virtual machines (VM) connecting to rogue networks.
- Understand traffic flow patterns across Azure regions and the internet to optimize your network deployment for performance and capacity.
- Pinpoint network misconfigurations leading to failed connections in your network.

> [!NOTE]
> Traffic Analytics now supports collecting NSG Flow Logs data at a higher frequency of 10 mins

## Why traffic analytics?

It is vital to monitor, manage, and know your own network for uncompromised security, compliance, and performance. Knowing your own environment is of paramount importance to protect and optimize it. You often need to know the current state of the network, who is connecting, where they're connecting from, which ports are open to the internet, expected network behavior, irregular network behavior, and sudden rises in traffic.

Cloud networks are different than on-premises enterprise networks, where you have netflow or equivalent protocol capable routers and switches, which provide the capability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits a network interface. By analyzing traffic flow data, you can build an analysis of network traffic flow and volume.

Azure virtual networks have NSG flow logs, which provide you information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a Network Security Group associated to individual network interfaces, VMs, or subnets. By analyzing raw NSG flow logs, and inserting intelligence of security, topology, and geography, traffic analytics can provide you with insights into traffic flow in your environment. Traffic Analytics provides information such as most communicating hosts, most communicating application protocols, most conversing host pairs, allowed/blocked traffic, inbound/outbound traffic, open internet ports, most blocking rules, traffic distribution per Azure datacenter, virtual network, subnets, or, rogue networks.

## Key components

- **Network security group (NSG)**: Contains a list of security rules that allow or deny network traffic to resources connected to an Azure Virtual Network. NSGs can be associated to subnets, individual VMs (classic), or individual network interfaces (NIC) attached to VMs (Resource Manager). For more information, see [Network security group overview](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json).
- **Network security group (NSG) flow logs**: Allow you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a network security group. NSG flow logs are written in json format and show outbound and inbound flows on a per rule basis, the NIC the flow applies to, five-tuple information about the flow (source/destination IP address, source/destination port, and protocol), and if the traffic was allowed or denied. For more information about NSG flow logs, see [NSG flow logs](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview.md).
- **Log Analytics**: An Azure service that collects monitoring data and stores the data in a central repository. This data can include events, performance data, or custom data provided through the Azure API. Once collected, the data is available for alerting, analysis, and export. Monitoring applications such as network performance monitor and traffic analytics are built using Azure Monitor logs as a foundation. For more information, see [Azure Monitor logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json).
- **Log Analytics workspace**: An instance of Azure Monitor logs, where the data pertaining to an Azure account, is stored. For more information about Log Analytics workspaces, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json).
- **Network Watcher**: A regional service that enables you to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network scenario level in Azure. You can turn NSG flow logs on and off with Network Watcher. For more information, see [Network Watcher](network-watcher-monitoring-overview.md).

## How traffic analytics works

Traffic analytics examines the raw NSG flow logs and captures reduced logs by aggregating common flows among the same source IP address, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol. For example, Host 1 (IP address: 10.10.10.10) communicating to Host 2 (IP address: 10.10.20.10), 100 times over a period of 1 hour using port (for example, 80) and protocol (for example, http). The reduced log has one entry, that Host 1 & Host 2 communicated 100 times over a period of 1 hour using port *80* and protocol *HTTP*, instead of having 100 entries. Reduced logs are enhanced with geography, security, and topology information, and then stored in a Log Analytics workspace. The following picture shows the data flow:

## Prerequisites

### User access requirements

Your account must be a member of one of the following [Azure built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json):

|Deployment model   | Role                   |
|---------          |---------               |
|Resource Manager   | Owner                  |
|                   | Contributor            |
|                   | Reader                 |
|                   | Network Contributor    |

If your account is not assigned to one of the built-in roles, it must be assigned to a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json) that is assigned the following actions, at the subscription level:

- "Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/connections/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read"
- "Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/read"
