# Create and provision a Cluster using Azure CLI

This article describes how to create a Cluster by using the Azure Command Line Interface (AzCLI). This document also shows you how to check the status, update, or delete a Cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Verify that Network Fabric Controller and Cluster Manger exist in your Azure region
- Verify that Network Fabric is successfully provisioned

## API guide and metrics

The [API guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/networkcloud/resource-manager) provides
information on the resource providers and resource models, and the APIs.

The metrics generated from the logging data are available in [Azure Monitor metrics](./list-of-metrics-collected.md).


## Create a Cluster

The Cluster resource represents an on-premises deployment of the platform
within the Cluster Manager. All other platform-specific resources are
dependent upon it for their lifecycle.

You should have successfully created the Network Fabric for this on-premises deployment.
Each Operator Nexus on-premises instance has a one-to-one association
with a Network Fabric.

Create the Cluster:

```azurecli
az networkcloud cluster create --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" --location "$LOCATION" \
  --extended-location name="$CL_NAME" type="CustomLocation" \
  --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RG" \
  --analytics-workspace-id "$LAW_ID" \
  --cluster-location "$CLUSTER_LOCATION" \
  --network-rack-id "$AGGR_RACK_RESOURCE_ID" \
  --rack-sku-id "$AGGR_RACK_SKU"\
  --rack-serial-number "$AGGR_RACK_SN" \
  --rack-location "$AGGR_RACK_LOCATION" \
  --bare-metal-machine-configuration-data "["$AGGR_RACK_BMM"]" \
  --storage-appliance-configuration-data '[{"adminCredentials":{"password":"$SA_PASS","username":"$SA_USER"},"rackSlot":1,"serialNumber":"$SA_SN","storageApplianceName":"$SA_NAME"}]' \
  --compute-rack-definitions '[{"networkRackId": "$COMPX_RACK_RESOURCE_ID", "rackSkuId": "$COMPX_RACK_SKU", "rackSerialNumber": "$COMPX_RACK_SN", "rackLocation": "$COMPX_RACK_LOCATION", "storageApplianceConfigurationData": [], "bareMetalMachineConfigurationData":[{"bmcCredentials": {"password":"$COMPX_SVRY_BMC_PASS", "username":"$COMPX_SVRY_BMC_USER"}, "bmcMacAddress":"$COMPX_SVRY_BMC_MAC", "bootMacAddress":"$COMPX_SVRY_BOOT_MAC", "machineDetails":"$COMPX_SVRY_SERVER_DETAILS", "machineName":"$COMPX_SVRY_SERVER_NAME"}]}]'\
  --managed-resource-group-configuration name="$MRG_NAME" location="$MRG_LOCATION" \
  --network fabric-id "$NFC_ID" \
  --cluster-service-principal application-id="$SP_APP_ID" \
    password="$SP_PASS" principal-id="$SP_ID" tenant-id="$TENANT_ID" \
  --cluster-type "$CLUSTER_TYPE" --cluster-version "$CLUSTER_VERSION" \
  --tags $TAG_KEY1="$TAG_VALUE1" $TAG_KEY2="$TAG_VALUE2"

az networkcloud cluster wait --created --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" --resource-group
"$CLUSTER_RG"
```

You can instead create a Cluster with ARM template/parameter files in
[ARM Template Editor](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template):

### Cluster validation

A successful Operator Nexus Cluster creation will result in the creation of an AKS cluster
inside your subscription. The cluster ID, cluster provisioning state and
deployment state are returned as a result of a successful `cluster create`.

View the status of the Cluster:

```azurecli
az networkcloud cluster show --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RG" \
  --resource-name "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_NAME"
```

The Cluster deployment is complete when the `provisioningState` of the resource
shows: `"provisioningState": "Succeeded"`

### Cluster logging

Cluster create Logs can be viewed in the following locations:

1. Azure portal Resource/ResourceGroup Activity logs.
2. Azure CLI with `--debug` flag passed on command-line.

## Deploy Cluster

Once a Cluster has been created and the Rack Manifests have been added, the
deploy cluster action can be triggered. The deploy Cluster action creates the
bootstrap image and deploys the Cluster.

Deploy Cluster will initiate a sequence of events to occur in the Cluster Manager

1.  Validation of the cluster/rack properties
2.  Generation of a bootable image for the ephemeral bootstrap cluster
    (Validation of Infrastructure).
3.  Interaction with the IPMI interface of the targeted bootstrap machine.
4.  Perform hardware validation checks
5.  Monitoring of the Cluster deployment process.

Deploy the on-premises Cluster:

```azurecli
az networkcloud cluster deploy \
  --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

## Cluster deployment validation

View the status of the cluster:

```azurecli
az networkcloud Cluster show --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RG" \
  --resource-name "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_NAME"
```

The Cluster deployment is complete when the `provisioningState` of the resource
shows: `"provisioningState": "Succeeded"`

## Cluster deployment Logging

Cluster create Logs can be viewed in the following locations:

1. Azure portal Resource/ResourceGroup Activity logs.
2. Azure CLI with `--debug` flag passed on command-line.
