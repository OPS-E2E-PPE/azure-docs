# How to view the output of an `az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-read-command` in the Cluster Manager Storage account

This guide walks you through accessing the output file that is created in the Cluster Manager Storage account when an `az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-read-command` is executed on a server. The name of the file is identified in the `az rest` status output.

1. Open the Cluster Manager Managed Resource Group for the Cluster where the server is housed and then select the **Storage account**.

1. In the Storage account details, select **Storage browser** from the navigation menu on the left side.

1. In the Storage browser details, select on **Blob containers**.

1. Select the baremetal-run-command-output blob container.

1. Select the output file from the run-read command. The file name can be identified from the `az rest --method get` command. Additionally, the **Last modified** timestamp aligns with when the command was executed.

1. You can manage & download the output file from the **Overview** pop-out.

For information on running the `run-read-command`, see:
