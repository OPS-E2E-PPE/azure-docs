# Monitor Azure AD B2C with Azure Monitor

Use Azure Monitor to route Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) sign-in and [auditing](view-audit-logs.md) logs to different monitoring solutions. You can retain the logs for long-term use or integrate with third-party security information and event management (SIEM) tools to gain insights into your environment.

You can route log events to:

* An Azure storage account.
* An Azure event hub (and integrate with your Splunk and Sumo Logic instances).
* An Azure Log Analytics workspace (to analyze data, create dashboards, and alert on specific events).

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you deploy an Azure Resource Manager template by using the Azure PowerShell module.

* [Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) version 6.13.1 or higher

You can also use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com), which includes the latest version of the Azure PowerShell module.

## Delegated resource management

Azure AD B2C leverages [Azure Active Directory monitoring](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-monitoring.md). To enable *Diagnostic settings* in Azure Active Directory within your Azure AD B2C tenant, you use [delegated resource management](../lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md).

You authorize a user in your Azure AD B2C directory (the **Service Provider**) to configure the Azure Monitor instance within the tenant that contains your Azure subscription (the **Customer**). To create the authorization, you deploy an [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/index.yml) template to your Azure AD tenant containing the subscription. The following sections walk you through the process.

## Create a resource group

In the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that contains your Azure subscription (*not* the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant), [create a resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#create-resource-groups). Use the following values:

* **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
* **Resource group**: Enter name for the resource group. For example, *azure-ad-b2c-monitor*.
* **Region**: Select an Azure location. For example, *Central US*.

## Delegate resource management

Next, gather the following information:

**Directory ID** of your Azure AD B2C directory (also known as the tenant ID).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a user with the *User administrator* role (or higher).
1. Select the **Directory + Subscription** icon in the portal toolbar, and then select the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Properties**.
1. Record the **Directory ID**.

**Object ID** of the Azure AD B2C group or user you want to give *Contributor* permission to the resource group you created earlier in the directory containing your subscription.

To make management easier, we recommend using Azure AD user *groups* for each role, allowing you to add or remove individual users to the group rather than assigning permissions directly to that user. In this walkthrough, you add a user.

1. With **Azure Active Directory** still selected in the Azure portal, select **Users**, and then select a user.
1. Record the user's **Object ID**.

### Create an Azure Resource Manager template

To onboard your Azure AD tenant (the **Customer**), create an [Azure Resource Manager template](../lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer.md) for your offer with the following information. The `mspOfferName` and `mspOfferDescription` values are visible when you view offer details in the [Service providers page](../lighthouse/how-to/view-manage-service-providers.md) of the Azure portal.

| Field   | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| `mspOfferName`                     | A name describing this definition. For example, *Azure AD B2C Managed Services*. This value is displayed to the customer as the title of the offer. |
| `mspOfferDescription`              | A brief description of your offer. For example, *Enables Azure Monitor in Azure AD B2C*.|
| `rgName`                           | The name of the resource group you create earlier in your Azure AD tenant. For example, *azure-ad-b2c-monitor*. |
| `managedByTenantId`                | The **Directory ID** of your Azure AD B2C tenant (also known as the tenant ID). |
| `authorizations.value.principalId` | The **Object ID** of the B2C group or user that will have access to resources in this Azure subscription. For this walkthrough, specify the user's Object ID that you recorded earlier. |

Download the Azure Resource Manager template and parameter files:

- [rgDelegatedResourceManagement.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Lighthouse-samples/master/Azure-Delegated-Resource-Management/templates/rg-delegated-resource-management/rgDelegatedResourceManagement.json)
- [rgDelegatedResourceManagement.parameters.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Lighthouse-samples/master/Azure-Delegated-Resource-Management/templates/rg-delegated-resource-management/rgDelegatedResourceManagement.parameters.json)

Next, update the parameters file with the values you recorded earlier. The following JSON snippet shows an example of an Azure Resource Manager template parameters file. For `authorizations.value.roleDefinitionId`, use the [built-in role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) value for the *Contributor role*, `b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c`.

```JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "mspOfferName": {
            "value": "Azure AD B2C Managed Services"
        },
        "mspOfferDescription": {
            "value": "Enables Azure Monitor in Azure AD B2C"
        },
        "rgName": {
            "value": "azure-ad-b2c-monitor"
        },
        "managedByTenantId": {
            "value": "<Replace with DIRECTORY ID of Azure AD B2C tenant (tenant ID)>"
        },
        "authorizations": {
            "value": [
                {
                    "principalId": "<Replace with user's OBJECT ID>",
                    "principalIdDisplayName": "Azure AD B2C tenant administrator",
                    "roleDefinitionId": "b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Deploy the Azure Resource Manager templates

Once you've updated your parameters file, deploy the Azure Resource Manager template into the Azure tenant as a subscription-level deployment. Because this is a subscription-level deployment, it cannot be initiated in the Azure portal. You can deploy by using the Azure PowerShell module or the Azure CLI. The Azure PowerShell method is shown below.

Sign in to the directory containing your subscription by using [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps). Use the `-tenant` flag to force authentication to the correct directory.

```PowerShell
Connect-AzAccount -tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

Use the [Get-AzSubscription](/powershell/module/az.accounts/get-azsubscription) cmdlet to list the subscriptions that the current account can access under the Azure AD tenant. Record the ID of the subscription you want to project into your Azure AD B2C tenant.

```PowerShell
Get-AzSubscription
```

Next, switch to the subscription you want to project into the Azure AD B2C tenant:

``` PowerShell
Select-AzSubscription <subscription ID>
```

Finally, deploy the Azure Resource Manager template and parameter files you downloaded and updated earlier. Replace the `Location`, `TemplateFile`, and `TemplateParameterFile` values accordingly.

```PowerShell
New-AzDeployment -Name "AzureADB2C" `
                 -Location "centralus" `
                 -TemplateFile "C:\Users\azureuser\Documents\rgDelegatedResourceManagement.json" `
                 -TemplateParameterFile "C:\Users\azureuser\Documents\rgDelegatedResourceManagement.parameters.json" `
                 -Verbose
```

Successful deployment of the template produces output similar to the following (output truncated for brevity):

```Console
PS /usr/csuser/clouddrive> New-AzDeployment -Name "AzureADB2C" `
>>                  -Location "centralus" `
>>                  -TemplateFile "rgDelegatedResourceManagement.json" `
>>                  -TemplateParameterFile "rgDelegatedResourceManagement.parameters.json" `
>>                  -Verbose

```

After you deploy the template, it can take a few minutes for the resource projection to complete. You may need to wait a few minutes (typically no more than five) before moving on to the next section to select the subscription.

## Select your subscription

Once you've deployed the template and have waited a few minutes for the resource projection to complete, associate your subscription to your Azure AD B2C directory with the following steps.

1. **Sign out** of the Azure portal if you're currently signed in. This and the following step are done to refresh your credentials in the portal session.
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure AD B2C administrative account.
1. Select the **Directory + Subscription** icon in the portal toolbar.
1. Select the directory that contains your subscription.

    ![Switch directory](./media/azure-monitor/azure-monitor-portal-03-select-subscription.png)
1. Verify that you've selected the correct directory and subscription. In this example, all directories and subscriptions are selected.

    ![All directories selected in Directory & Subscription filter](./media/azure-monitor/azure-monitor-portal-04-subscriptions-selected.png)

## Configure diagnostic settings

After you've delegated resource management and have selected your subscription, you're ready to [Create diagnostic settings](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-monitoring.md) in the Azure portal.

To configure monitoring settings for Azure AD B2C activity logs:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select the **Directory + Subscription** icon in the portal toolbar, and then select the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory**
1. Under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings**.
1. Select **+ Add diagnostic setting**.
