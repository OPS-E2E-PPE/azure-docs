# Quickstart: Use a Remote Desktop client to connect to a dev box

After you configure the Microsoft Dev Box Preview service and create dev boxes, you can connect to them by using a browser or by using a Remote Desktop client.

Remote Desktop apps let you use and control a dev box from almost any device. For your desktop or laptop, you can choose to download the Remote Desktop client for Windows Desktop or Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac. You can also download a Remote Desktop app for your mobile device: Microsoft Remote Desktop for iOS or Microsoft Remote Desktop for Android.

In this quickstart, you download a Remote Desktop client (Windows and non-Windows). You then use that client to connect to a dev box.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you must first:

- [Configure Microsoft Dev Box Preview](./quickstart-configure-dev-box-service.md).
- [Create a dev box](./quickstart-create-dev-box.md#create-a-dev-box) on the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

## Download the client and connect to your dev box

Remote Desktop clients are available for many operating systems and devices. In this quickstart, you can view the steps for Windows or the steps for a non-Windows operating system by selecting the relevant tab.

## Clean up resources

Dev boxes incur costs whenever they're running. When you finish using your dev box, shut down or stop it to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.

You can stop a dev box from the developer portal:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. For the dev box that you want to stop, select the **Actions** menu, and then select **Stop**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-connect-to-dev-box-with-remote-desktop-app/stop-dev-box.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the menu command to stop a dev box.":::

The dev box might take a few moments to stop.
