# Request a quota limit increase for Microsoft Dev Box resources

This article describes how to submit a support request for increasing the number of resources for Microsoft Dev Box in your Azure subscription. 

When you reach the limit for a resource in your subscription, you can request a limit increase (sometimes called a capacity increase, or a quota increase) to extend the number of resources available. The request process allows the Microsoft Dev Box team to ensure that your subscription isn't involved in any cases of fraud or unintentional, sudden large-scale deployments. 

The time it takes to increase your quota varies depending on the VM size, region, and number of resources requested.  You won't have to go through the process of requesting extra capacity often. To ensure you have the resources you require when you need them, you should:

- Request capacity as far in advance as possible.
- If possible, be flexible on the region where you're requesting capacity.
- Recognize that capacity remains assigned for the lifetime of a subscription. When dev box resources are deleted, the capacity remains assigned to the subscription. 
- Request extra capacity only if you need more than is already assigned to your subscription. 
- Make incremental requests for VM cores rather than making large, bulk requests. Break requests for large numbers of cores into smaller requests for extra flexibility in how those requests are fulfilled.

Learn more about the general [process for creating Azure support requests](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

## Prerequisites

- To create a support request, your Azure account needs the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner), [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Support Request Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#support-request-contributor) role at the subscription level.
- Before you create a support request for a limit increase, you need to gather additional information.

## Gather information for your request

You'll find submitting a support request for additional quota is quicker if you gather the required information before you begin the request process. 

- **Determine your current quota usage**

   For each of your subscriptions, you can check your current usage of each Deployment Environments resource type in each region. Determine your current usage by following these steps: [Determine usage and quota](./how-to-determine-your-quota-usage.md).

- **Determine the region for the additional quota**

   Dev Box resources can exist in many regions. You can choose to deploy resources in multiple regions close to your dev box users. For more information about Azure regions, how they relate to global geographies, and which services are available in each region, see [Azure global infrastructure](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).

- **Choose the quota type of the additional quota.**

   The following Dev Box resources are limited by subscription. You can request an increase in the number of resources for each of these types.

   - Dev box definitions
   - Dev centers
   - Network settings
   - Pools
   - Projects
   - Network connections
   - Dev Box general cores
   - Other
 
   When you want to increase the number of dev boxes available to your developers, you should request an increase in the number of Dev Box general cores.
