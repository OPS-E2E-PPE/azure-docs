## Download the remote desktop client and connect to your dev box

You can use a remote desktop client application to connect to your dev box in Microsoft Dev Box. Remote desktop clients are available for many operating systems and devices. 

Select the relevant tab to view the steps to download and use the Remote Desktop client application from Windows or non-Windows operating systems.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

### Download the Remote Desktop client for Windows

To download and set up the Remote Desktop client for Windows:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. Select **Open in RDP client** for the dev box that you want to connect.

1. After the Remote Desktop MSI file downloads to your computer, open the file and follow the prompts to install the Remote Desktop app. 

### Connect to a dev box by using a subscription URL

Each dev box project is represented as a Workspace in Remote Desktop. When you're working with multiple dev boxes, across multiple projects, you can use Remote Desktop to switch between them. To make a switch, you need to add the subscription URL for each Workspace to Remote Desktop. With the Remote Desktop app, you can subscribe to multiple Workspaces, allowing you to view and connect to all your dev boxes.  

To get the subscription URL for your Workspace:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).
 
1. Open help (**?**), and then select **Configure Remote Desktop**. 
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-connect-to-dev-box-with-remote-desktop-app/dev-box-rdp-get-subscription-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the developer portal help pane with subscription URL highlighted.":::

1. In **Configure Remote Desktop**, next to the subscription feed URL, select **Copy**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-connect-to-dev-box-with-remote-desktop-app/dev-box-rdp-subscription-windows.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure Remote Desktop dialog with the subscription feed URL highlighted.":::
