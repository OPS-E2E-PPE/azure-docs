<!-- As a lab administrator, I want more cores available for my subscription so that I can support more students. -->

# Request a core limit increase
If you reach the cores limit for your subscription, you can request a limit increase to continue using Azure Lab Services. The request process allows the Azure Lab Services team to ensure your subscription isn't involved in any cases of fraud or unintentional, sudden large-scale deployments. 

For information about creating support requests in general, see how to create a [How to create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).
## Prepare to submit a request
Before you begin your request for a capacity increase, you should make sure that you have all the information you need available and verify that you have the appropriate permissions. Review this article, and gather information like the number and size of cores you want to add, the regions you can use, and the location of resources like your existing labs and virtual networks.  

### Permissions
To create a support request, you must be assigned to one of the following roles at the subscription level:
 - [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)
 - [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)
 - [Support Request Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)

### Determine the regions for your labs
Azure Lab Services resources can exist in many regions. You can choose to deploy resources in multiple regions close to your students. For more information about Azure regions, how they relate to global geographies, and which services are available in each region, see [Azure global infrastructure](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).

### Locate and copy lab plan or lab account resource ID
To add extra capacity to an existing lab, you must specify the lab's resource ID when you make the request. 

Use the following steps to locate and copy the resource ID so that you can paste it into your support request.   
1.	In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the lab plan or lab account you want to add cores to. 

1.	Under Settings, select Properties, and then copy the **Resource ID**.

1. Paste the Resource ID into a document for safekeeping; you'll need it to complete the support request.

## Start a new support request
You can follow these steps to request a limit increase:  

1. In the Azure portal, in Support & Troubleshooting, select **Help + support**  
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-request-capacity-increase/support-troubleshooting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing Support & troubleshooting with Help + support highlighted.":::
1. On the Help + support page, select **Create support request**.
  :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-request-capacity-increase/create-support-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Help + support page with Create support request highlighted.":::

1. On the New support request page, use the following information to complete the **Problem description**, and then select **Next**.

   |Name  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |**Issue type**|Service and subscription limits (quotas)|
   |**Subscription**|The subscription you want to extend.|
   |**Quota type**|Azure Lab Services|

1. The **Recommended solution** tab isn't required for service and subscription limits (quotas) issues, so it is skipped.

1. On the Additional details tab, in the **Problem details** section, select **Enter details**.

## Make core limit increase request
When you request core limit increase (sometimes called an increase in capacity), you must supply some information to help the Azure Lab Services team evaluate and action your request as quickly as possible. The more information you can supply and the earlier you supply it, the more quickly the Azure Lab Services team will be able to process your request. 

The information required for the lab accounts used in original version of Lab Services (May 2019) and the lab plans used in the updated version of Lab Services (August 2022) is different. Use the appropriate tab below to guide you as you complete the **Quota details**. 
#### [Lab Accounts](#tab/LabAccounts/)
