# Example class types on Azure Lab Services
This article provides a list of example classes you can set up on Azure Lab Services.

## Deep learning in natural language processing
You can set up a lab focused on deep learning in natural language processing (NLP) using Azure Lab Services. Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers with translation, speech recognition, and other language understanding capabilities. Students taking an NLP class get a Linux virtual machine (VM) to learn how to apply neural network algorithms to develop deep learning models that are used for analyzing written human language. 

For detailed information on how to set up this type of a lab, see [Set up a lab focused on deep learning in natural language processing using Azure Lab Services](class-type-deep-learning-natural-processing.md).

## Shell scripting on Linux
You can set up a lab to teach shell scripting on Linux. Scripting is a useful part of system administration that allows administrators to avoid repetitive tasks. In this sample scenario, the class covers traditional bash scripts and enhanced scripts. Enhanced scripts are scripts that combine bash commands and Ruby. This approach allows Ruby to pass data around and bash commands to interact with the shell. 

Students taking these scripting classes get a Linux virtual machine to learn the basics of Linux, and also get familiar with the bash shell scripting. The Linux virtual machine comes with remote desktop access enabled and with [gedit](https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editors installed.

For detailed information on how to set up this type of a lab, see [Shell scripting on Linux](class-type-shell-scripting-linux.md).
