# Form Recognizer models

Azure Form Recognizer prebuilt models enable you to add intelligent document processing to your apps and flows without having to train and build your own models. Prebuilt models use optical character recognition (OCR) combined with deep learning models to identify and extract predefined text and data fields common to specific form and document types. Form Recognizer extracts analyzes form and document data then  returns an organized, structured JSON response. Form Recognizer v2.1 supports invoice, receipt, ID document, and business card models.

### General document (preview)

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/general-document.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Studio general document icon.":::

* The general document API supports most form types and will analyze your documents and associate values to keys and entries to tables that it discovers. It's ideal for extracting common key-value pairs from documents. You can use the general document model as an alternative to training a custom model without labels.

* The general document is a pre-trained model and can be directly invoked via the REST API.

* The general document model supports named entity recognition (NER) for several entity categories. NER is the ability to identify different entities in text and categorize them into pre-defined classes or types such as: person, location, event, product, and organization. Extracting entities can be useful in scenarios where you want to validate extracted values. The entities are extracted from the entire content.

### Invoice

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/invoice.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Studio invoice icon.":::

The invoice model analyzes and extracts key information from sales invoices. The API analyzes invoices in various formats and extracts key information such as customer name, billing address, due date, and amount due. Currently, the model supports both English and Spanish invoices.

### Receipt

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/receipt.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Studio receipt icon.":::

The receipt model analyzes and extracts key information from sales receipts. The API analyzes printed and handwritten receipts and extracts key information such as merchant name, merchant phone number, transaction date, tax, and transaction total.

### ID document

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/id-document.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Studio identity document icon.":::

The ID document model analyzes and extracts key information from U.S. Driver's Licenses (all 50 states and District of Columbia) and biographical pages from international passports (excluding visa and other travel documents). The API analyzes identity documents and extracts key information such as first name, last name, address, and date of birth.

### W-2 (preview)

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/w2.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Studio W-2 icon.":::

The W-2 model analyzes and extracts key information reported in each box on a W-2 form. The model supports standard and customized forms from 2018 to the present, including both single form and multiple forms (copy A, B, C, D, 1, 2) on one page. 

***Sample W-2 document processed using [Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=tax.us.w2)***:

### Business card

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/business-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Studio business card icon.":::

The business card model analyzes and extracts key information from business card images. The API analyzes printed business card images and extracts key information such as first name, last name, company name, email address, and phone number.

### Custom

 :::image type="content" source="media/studio/custom.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Form Recognizer Studio custom icon.":::

The custom model analyzes and extracts data from forms and documents specific to your business. The API is a machine-learning program trained to recognize form fields within your distinct content and extract key-value pairs and table data. You only need five examples of the same form type to get started and your custom model can be trained with or without labeled datasets.

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 50 MB.
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions are up to 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size, or smaller.
* The total size of the training data is 500 pages or less.
* If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
* For unsupervised learning (without labeled data):
  * Data must contain keys and values.
  * Keys must appear above or to the left of the values; they can't appear below or to the right.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Sample Labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/) does not support the BMP file format. This is a limitation of the tool not the Form Recognizer Service.
