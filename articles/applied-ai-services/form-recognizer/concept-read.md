# Form Recognizer read model

The Form Recognizer v3.0 preview includes the new Read API. Read extracts printed and handwritten from documents. The read model can detect lines, words, locations, and languages and is the core of all the other Form Recognizer models. Layout, general document, custom, and prebuilt models all use the read model as a foundation for extracting texts from documents.

## Development options

The following resources are supported by Form Recognizer v3.0:

| Feature | Resources | Model ID |
|----------|------------|------------|
|**Read model**| <ul><li>[**Form Recognizer Studio**](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com)</li><li>[**REST API**](how-to-guides/use-prebuilt-read.md?pivots=programming-language-rest-api)</li><li>[**C# SDK**](how-to-guides/use-prebuilt-read.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp)</li><li>[**Python SDK**](how-to-guides/use-prebuilt-read.md?pivots=programming-language-python)</li><li>[**Java SDK**](how-to-guides/use-prebuilt-read.md?pivots=programming-language-java)</li><li>[**JavaScript**](how-to-guides/use-prebuilt-read.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript)</li></ul>|**prebuilt-read**|

### Try Form Recognizer

See how text is extracted from forms and documents using the Form Recognizer Studio. You'll need the following assets:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG/JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 500 MB for paid (S0) tier and 4 MB for free (F0) tier (4 MB for the free tier)
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.

## Supported languages and locales

Form Recognizer preview version supports several languages for the read model. *See* our [Language Support](language-support.md) for a complete list of supported handwritten and printed languages.

## Features

### Text lines and words

Read API extracts text from documents and images with multiple text angles and colors. It accepts photos of documents, faxes, printed and/or handwritten (English only) text, and mixed modes. Text is extracted from data provided in lines, words, bounding boxes, confidence scores, and style.

### Language detection (v3.0 preview)

Read API in v3.0 preview 2 adds [language detection](language-support.md#detected-languages-read-api) as a new feature for text lines. Read will predict the language at the text line level along with the confidence score.

### Handwritten classification for text lines (Latin only)

The response includes classifying whether each text line is of handwriting style or not, along with a confidence score. This feature is only supported for Latin languages. 

### Select page (s) for text extraction

For large multi-page documents, use the `pages` query parameter to indicate specific page numbers or page ranges for text extraction.
