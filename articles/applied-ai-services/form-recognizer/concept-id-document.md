# Form Recognizer ID document model

The ID document model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extracts key information from U.S. Driver's Licenses (all 50 states and District of Columbia) and international passport biographical pages (excluding visa and other travel documents). The API analyzes identity documents; extracts key information such as first name, last name, address, and date of birth; and returns a structured JSON data representation.

## Try Form Recognizer Studio (Preview)

* Form Recognizer studio is available with the preview (v3.0) API.

* Extract name, machine-readable zone, expiration date with our Form Recognizer Studio ID document feature:

## Try it: Sample labeling tool

You can see how ID document data is extracted by trying our Sample labeling tool. You'll need the following:

* An Azure subscriptionâ€”you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) ) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, click **Go to resource** to get your API key and endpoint.

* An ID document. You can use our [sample ID document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/id-license.jpg).

In the Form Recognizer UI:

  1. Select **Use prebuilt model to get data**.
  1. Select **Receipt** from the **Form Type** dropdown menu:

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 50 MB.
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions are up to 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size, or smaller.
* The total size of the training data is 500 pages or less.
* If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
* For unsupervised learning (without labeled data):
  * data must contain keys and values.
  * keys must appear above or to the left of the values; they can't appear below or to the right.

> [!NOTE]
> The [sample labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/) does not support the BMP file format. This is a limitation of the tool not the Form Recognizer Service.
