# Form Recognizer receipt model

The receipt model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract key information from sales receipts. Receipts can be of various formats and quality including printed and handwritten receipts. The API extracts key information such as merchant name, merchant phone number, transaction date, tax, and transaction total and returns a structured JSON data representation.

##### Sample receipt processed with [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/):

## Try Form Recognizer Studio (Preview)

* Form Recognizer studio is available with the preview (v3.0) API.

* Extract time and date of transactions, merchant information, amount totals, and more with our Form Recognizer Studio Receipt feature:

## Try it: Sample labeling tool

You can see how receipt data is extracted by trying our Sample labeling tool. You'll need the following:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) ) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, click **Go to resource** to get your API key and endpoint.

 :::image type="content" source="media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot: keys and endpoint location in the Azure portal.":::

* A receipt document. You can use our [sample receipt document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/contoso-receipt.png).

In the Form Recognizer UI:

  1. Select **Use prebuilt model to get data**.
  1. Select **Receipt** from the **Form Type** dropdown menu:

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 50 MB.
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions are up to 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size, or smaller.
* The total size of the training data is 500 pages or less.
* If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
* For unsupervised learning (without labeled data):
  * data must contain keys and values.
  * keys must appear above or to the left of the values; they can't appear below or to the right.

## Supported languages and locales v2.1

>[!NOTE]
 > It's not necessary to specify a locale. This is an optional parameter. The Form Recognizer deep-learning technology will auto-detect the language of the text in your image.
