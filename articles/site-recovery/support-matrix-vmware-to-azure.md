# Support matrix for VMware and physical server replication to Azure


This article summarizes supported components and settings for disaster recovery of VMware VMs to Azure by using [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).


## Supported scenarios

**Scenario** | **Details**
--- | ---
**VMware VMs** | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for on-premises VMware VMs. You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.
**Physical servers** | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for on-premises Windows/Linux physical servers. You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal.

## On-premises virtualization servers

**Server** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**VMware** | vCenter Server 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 or vSphere 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 | We recommend that you use a vCenter server.
**Physical servers** | N/A


## Replicated machines

The following table summarizes replication support for machines. Site Recovery supports replication of any workload running on a machine with a supported operating system.

**Component** | **Details**
--- | ---
Machine configuration | Machines that replicate to Azure must meet [Azure requirements](#failed-over-azure-vm-requirements).
Machine operating system (Windows) | 64-bit Windows Server 2016 (Server Core, Server with Desktop Experience), Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1
Machine operating system (Linux) | Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 5.2 to 5.11, 6.1 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.4 <br/><br/>CentOS: 5.2 to 5.11, 6.1 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.4 <br/><br/>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server[ (supported kernel versions)](#supported-ubuntu-kernel-versions-for-vmwarephysical-servers)<br/><br/>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server[ (supported kernel versions)](#supported-ubuntu-kernel-versions-for-vmwarephysical-servers)<br/><br/>Debian 7 <br/><br/>Debian 8<br/><br/>Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4, 6.5 running either the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3) <br/><br/>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 <br/><br/>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 <br/>(Upgrade of replicating machines from SLES 11 SP3 to SLES 11 SP4 isn't supported. If a replicated machine is upgraded from SLES 11SP3 to SLES 11 SP4, you need to disable replication and protect the machine again post the upgrade.)

>[!NOTE]
>
> - On Linux distributions, only the stock kernels that are part of the minor version release/update of the distribution are supported.
>
> - Upgrades across major versions of a Linux distribution on a Site Recovery-protected VMware virtual machine or physical server aren't supported. When you upgrade the operating system across major versions (for example, CentOS 6.* to CentOS 7.*), disable replication for the machine, upgrade the operating system on the machine, and then enable replication again.

**Guest operating system architecture** | 64-bit | Prerequisites check fails if unsupported.
**Operating system disk size** | Up to 2,048 GB | Prerequisites check fails if unsupported.
**Operating system disk count** | 1 | Prerequisites check fails if unsupported.
