# Support matrix for VMware and physical server replication to Azure

This article summarizes supported components and settings for disaster recovery of VMware VMs to Azure by using [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).

## Supported scenarios

**Scenario** | **Details**
--- | ---
VMware VMs | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for on-premises VMware VMs. You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.
Physical servers | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for on-premises Windows/Linux physical servers. You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal.

## On-premises virtualization servers

**Server** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
VMware | vCenter Server 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 or vSphere 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 | We recommend that you use a vCenter server.
Physical | N/A


## Replicated machines

The following table summarizes replication support for VMware VMs and physical servers. Site Recovery supports replication of any workload running on a machine with a supported operating system.

**Component** | **Details**
--- | ---
Machine settings | Machines that replicate to Azure must meet [Azure requirements](#azure-vm-requirements).
Windows operating system | 64-bit Windows Server 2016 (Server Core, Server with Desktop Experience), Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1. Windows 2016 Nano Server isn't supported.
Linux operating system | Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 5.2 to 5.11, 6.1 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.4 <br/><br/>CentOS: 5.2 to 5.11, 6.1 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.4 <br/><br/>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server[ (supported kernel versions)](#supported-ubuntu-kernel-versions-for-vmwarephysical-servers)<br/><br/>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server[ (supported kernel versions)](#supported-ubuntu-kernel-versions-for-vmwarephysical-servers)<br/><br/>Debian 7/Debian 8<br/><br/>Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4, 6.5 running the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3) <br/><br/>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 <br/><br/>Upgrading replicated machines from SP3 to SP4 isn't supported. To upgrade, disable replication and enable it again after the upgrade.

>[!NOTE]
>
> - On Linux distributions, only the stock kernels that are part of the distribution minor version release/update are supported.
>
> - Upgrading protected machines across major Linux distribution versions isn't supported. To upgrade, disable replication, upgrade the operating system, and then enable replication again.
