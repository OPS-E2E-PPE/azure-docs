# TLS termination with Key Vault certificates

[Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md) is a platform-managed secret store that you can use to safeguard secrets, keys, and TLS/SSL certificates. Azure Application Gateway supports integration with Key Vault for server certificates that are attached to HTTPS-enabled listeners. This support is limited to the v2 SKU of Application Gateway.

Key Vault integration offers two models for TLS termination:

- You can explicitly provide TLS/SSL certificates attached to the listener. This model is the traditional way to pass TLS/SSL certificates to Application Gateway for TLS termination.
- You can optionally provide a reference to an existing Key Vault certificate or secret when you create an HTTPS-enabled listener.

Application Gateway integration with Key Vault offers many benefits, including:

- Stronger security, because TLS/SSL certificates aren't directly handled by the application development team. Integration allows a separate security team to:
  * Set up application gateways.
  * Control application gateway lifecycles.
  * Grant permissions to selected application gateways to access certificates that are stored in your key vault.
- Support for importing existing certificates into your key vault. Or use Key Vault APIs to create and manage new certificates with any of the trusted Key Vault partners.
- Support for automatic renewal of certificates that are stored in your key vault.

Application Gateway currently supports software-validated certificates only. Hardware security module (HSM)-validated certificates are not supported. After Application Gateway is configured to use Key Vault certificates, its instances retrieve the certificate from Key Vault and install them locally for TLS termination. The instances also poll Key Vault at 4-hour intervals to retrieve a renewed version of the certificate, if it exists. If an updated certificate is found, the TLS/SSL certificate currently associated with the HTTPS listener is automatically rotated. 

Application Gateway uses Secret Identifier in Key Vault to reference the certificates. For Azure PowerShell, CLI, or ARM it is strongly recommended to use a secret identifier that doesn't specify a version. This way, Azure Application Gateway will automatically rotate the certificate, if a newer version is available in your Key Vault. An example of a secret URI without a version is `https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/`.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure portal only supports KeyVault Certificates, not secrets. Application Gateway still supports referencing secrets from KeyVault, but only through non-Portal resources like PowerShell, CLI, API, ARM templates, etc. 

> [!WARNING]
> Azure Application Gateway currently only supports Key Vault accounts in the same subscription as the Application Gateway resource. Choosing a Key Vault under a different subscription than your Application Gateway will result in a failure.

## Certificate settings in Key Vault

For TLS termination, Application Gateway supports certificates in Personal Information Exchange (PFX) format. You can either import an existing certificate or create a new one in your key vault. Ensure that the certificate's status is set to Enabled in Key Vault to avoid any failures.

## How integration works

Application Gateway integration with Key Vault is a three-step configuration process:

   ![Key vault certificates](media/key-vault-certs/ag-kv.png)

1. **Create a user-assigned managed identity**

   You create or reuse an existing user-assigned managed identity, which Application Gateway uses to retrieve certificates from Key Vault on your behalf. For more information, see [Create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity using the Azure portal](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md). This step creates a new identity in the Azure Active Directory tenant. The identity is trusted by the subscription that's used to create the identity.

1. **Configure your key vault**

    **Access Policies** - After you've created a certificate in key vault by referring to the preceding section, you must define Key Vault's Access Policies to use the user-assigned managed identity with your Key Vault.
    
      i) Go to key vault in the Azure portal.<br />
      ii) Open the Access policies pane.<br />
      iii) If using the permission model "Vault access policy": Click "+Add Access Policy". Choose "Get" permission for "Secret permissions" field and choose your user-assigned managed identity for "Select principal" field, and click on "Save".<br />
      iv) If using the permission model "Azure role-based access control": Add a role assignment for the user-managed identity to the Azure Key Vault for the role "Key Vault Secrets User."<br />

    **Firewalls and virtual networks** - When using a restricted key vault, you can configure your Application Gateway in the following manner.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Starting March 15th 2021, Key Vault recognizes Azure Application Gateway as one of the Trusted Services, thus allowing you to build a secure network boundary in Azure. This gives you an ability to deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic) to Key Vault but still make it accessible for Application Gateway resource under your subscription.
   > 
   > Please note, in addition to the **Trusted Services** setting, you will need to allow your **Application Gateway's subnet** with **Service endpoint configuration** to grant access for all the scenarios.

      a) Under Key Vault’s Networking blade <br />
      b) Choose Private endpoint and selected networks in "Firewall and Virtual Networks" tab <br/>
      c) Then using Virtual Networks, add your Application Gateway’s virtual network and Subnet. During the process also configure ‘Microsoft.KeyVault' service endpoint by selecting its checkbox. <br/>
      d) Finally, select “Yes” to allow Trusted Services to bypass Key Vault’s firewall. <br/>

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you deploy the application gateway via an ARM template, either by using the Azure CLI or PowerShell, or via an Azure application deployed from the Azure portal, the SSL certificate is stored in the key vault as a base64-encoded PFX file. You must complete the steps in [Use Azure Key Vault to pass secure parameter value during deployment](../azure-resource-manager/templates/key-vault-parameter.md). 
   >
   > It's particularly important to set `enabledForTemplateDeployment` to `true`. The certificate may be passwordless or it may have a password. In the case of a certificate with a password, the following example shows a possible configuration for the `sslCertificates` entry in the `properties` for the ARM template configuration for an app gateway. The values of `appGatewaySSLCertificateData` and `appGatewaySSLCertificatePassword` are looked up from the key vault as described in the section [Reference secrets with dynamic ID](../azure-resource-manager/templates/key-vault-parameter.md#reference-secrets-with-dynamic-id). Follow the references backward from `parameters('secretName')` to see how the lookup happens. If the certificate is passwordless, omit the `password` entry.
   >   
   > ```
   > "sslCertificates": [
   >     {
   >         "name": "appGwSslCertificate",
   >         "properties": {
   >             "data": "[parameters('appGatewaySSLCertificateData')]",
   >             "password": "[parameters('appGatewaySSLCertificatePassword')]"
   >         }
   >     }
   > ]
   > ```

1. **Configure the application gateway**

   After you complete the two preceding steps, you can assign the user-assigned managed identity for your application gateway through its Identity and access management (IAM). For PowerShell, see [Set-AzApplicationGatewayIdentity](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azapplicationgatewayidentity).


## Investigating and resolving Key Vault errors

Azure Application Gateway not only polls for the renewed certificate version on Key Vault at every 4-hour interval, but also logs any error and is integrated with Azure Advisor to surface any misconfiguration as a recommendation. The details of the recommendation contain the exact issue and the associated Key Vault resource. You can use this information along with the [troubleshooting guide](../application-gateway/application-gateway-key-vault-common-errors.md) to quickly resolve such configuration error. 

It is strongly recommended that you [configure Advisor Alerts](../advisor/advisor-alerts-portal.md) to stay updated when such a problem is detected. To set an alert for this specific case, use the Recommendation Type as "Resolve Azure Key Vault issue for your Application Gateway".
